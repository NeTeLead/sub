 hello and welcome to my channel let's tie is here and for this video today we're going to talk about one of the sixteen personality types of the myers-briggs personality type indicator so a lot of this information that I'm going to talk about today can be found on the website sixteen personalities calm but I decided to make it into a video because I know that like me a lot of other people would like to hear information instead of reading it and as far as which personality type we're going to talk about in this video today it's going to be is TJ which actually stands for I as in introversion s as in sensing T as in thinking and J is in judgment and the myers-briggs personality type if you don't know already can help you as a guide into improving your relationships and just understanding how people work and the way that they think and why they are the way they are also the is CJ a personality type is known as the logistician so for this personality type we're going to talk about some strengths and weaknesses some career paths and workplace habits and then we're going to conclude with an overview of this personality type so with that being said we're gonna get started so first we're going to talk about some of the strengths of the ISTJ personality type which are that they are honest and direct integrity is a very big deal for the ISTJ personality type and things like emotional manipulation mind games dishonesty are some things that you won't really find in this personality type or at least they really try to actively avoid things like that these are the types of people that there carry themselves in all their life situations with as much honesty and integrity as possible they are also strong-willed and dutiful so like I said about the integrity they make sure they implement that in their actions as well they like to work hard and stay focused on their goals so these are the types of people that will meet their obligations no matter what there are also very responsible people and if they make you a promise they're going to be sure to fulfill that promise IFC juries are the type of people that would rather pull an all-nighter to complete a project that they said that they would complete in a certain amount of time and deliver work that is incomplete or not up to par they are also calm and practical so in times of hardship that's when that comes into play and they're able to keep their feet on the ground and make clear irrational decisions they also like to create and enforce order so the primary goal of an ISTJ percent is to be effective in whatever they choose to do and they do believe in delegation and believe in letting everybody know about what everyone is supposed to do so that's when that creating and enforcing order comes into play so something do they don't really like are people who break the rules the established rules or who don't really follow orders is tjs are also Jack's of all trades but they would much more rather focus on statistics and facts than on suppose and concepts so some ISTJ weaknesses are that they are stubborn so like I said they focus on the facts and these would be the types of people that would say facts are facts you can't change them and they also tend to resist to new ideas that aren't really supported by facts yet this characteristic also tricks them a little bit into thinking that they can't be wrong or not really be able to accept when they're wrong but everybody can be wrong at times they can also be insensitive at times and while it isn't intentionally necessarily they can hurt the other personality types by being really honest like I said at the very beginning honesty is a key factor for them and it can be a strength but it can also it also has a downside and a candida weakness these are also the type of people that always go by the book and they like clearly defined rules and they don't really like deviating from that then as personality type names as ISTJ they are judgmental they think that opinions are opinions and facts are facts and those should be separated and IFC J's are unlikely to respect those that don't respect the facts or that remain willfully ignorant to the facts and try to shelter themselves from them they're the type of people that would why would you not want to know more about this or why would you not want to know the facts behind this certain thing is tjs can also often blame themselves unreasonably and that is because everybody has a tipping point even I asked jace so someone who is so honest and who has so much integrity in themselves like an IAS teach age when they feel a project or when they do something that wasn't up to their expectations they do believe that the responsibility of failure lies on themselves alone as far as career paths while many other personality types may be able to take on more flexible work that's not the case for is tjs now that doesn't mean that I asked to J's can't pursue certain career paths or they wouldn't be interested in certain things many of them actually wonder what goes on in certain professions but they would still crave dependability and that is reflected on the work that they choose to do so these are the people that would choose to work in cubicles or in offices and they like more of a structure so it is said that service positions like waiting tables or working retail jobs aren't really a very good fit for is tjs simply because they place facts above emotional matter so it is believed that they would be better in a position where they defend the rules or they're the keepers of certain facts for example so lawyers police law enforcement but when it comes to habits in the workplace is DJs are almost that poster child for the rightful dutiful always hard-working employee so they seek structure and and clearly defined lines and they do respect authority and hierarchy iesous days love responsibilities so there are the types of people that love handing in a project that they've completed and even though they're known as a little bit insensitive they're actually quite sensitive to criticism themselves and even when they have a lot of work to do and they have a full plate they're a little bit reluctant to say no I can't do that or no I can complete that or even to recognize that someone else could take over for them if you're working with an ISTJ personality type or if you are an is VJ personality type in the workplace it is believed that no one is more reliable to turning in a project on time and being dutiful than it is to do I have CJ's love responsibility and the power that comes from it so they do work very hard to meet those goals and to go above and beyond to deliver above and beyond their duties so very few of the personality types are as dedicated and as reliable as an is DJ and they're very good at creating and securing a safe work environment for themselves as well as for their loved ones however one thing that they could work on is to make sure that their weaknesses are turned into strengths or that they develop from those we if they make sure that those characteristics aren't as much of a liability as they are assets they would be invincible so that is my conclusion for the ISTJ personality type I hope that you've enjoyed this video and the information in it please subscribe to my channel as well
