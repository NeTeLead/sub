 hi this is dr. ken Jeong of dr. ken and welcome to Doc's support hey first question from Ashley at queasy big how do I know if I have the stomach flu or a hangover well honey did you drink last night mmm glug glug did you have food or did you have alcohol the Internet is not for stupidity ma'am the Internet is for smart established doctors like me and my friend Luis here think before you tweet okay another question okay Kellie underscore Sheridan one finally a great question how much vitamin C is too much yes sometimes too much vitamins is too much you always get these things on medical shows go on like should I take this supplement should I take this supplement and honestly you can get hypervitaminosis like if you go to G and C or some other stories they'll say like oh this you get like 2,000 percent of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin you know C you can actually get side effects and symptoms or GI symptoms from too much vitamins so it's probably good just to get like a hundred percent of the recommended daily allowance that's really all you need great question kelly sheridan i'm not supposed to pick favorites they told me not to the producer but you're my favorite bat petit macaron so it's like a weird skin tag under my eye that hurts when i rip it off what's up with that skin tag is a call to skin polyp in real life is render it can be anywhere along your body i think to rip off any lesion that you don't know about right under your eye I mean honestly I can't think of a more ill-advised stupid move than that they can numb up the area clip it off I've actually when I practice medicine someone had skin tags on their arm or extremities you could always freeze it off with liquid nitrogen and it doesn't hurt I highly recommend that you have a professional remove it professionally at captain handlebar ass now can we address the knee reflex tests at the doctor's office this has to be useless right no it's not useless we're not monkeys that use these just for props we're not the carrot top of doctors here and I can just show you right here this is a knee there's a tendon that connects the knee to the leg bone okay called the tibia there's a 10 in here you want to check the reflex of this you go oh let me just check that and what that does it's actually it checks really your whole nervous system in many ways to see that if your reflexes are intact low thyroid levels in your body which is very common called hypothyroidism you actually will be hyporeflexia and you would not be able to elicit much of a reflex so this sucker is very important okay don't mock our tools okay we're pros and we're sensitive emotionally mm-hmm-hmm busy so to ask how do you check your pulse good check it here you check it here even check it here on your leg a baby could tell you how to check a pulse oh no no you can't you can't ask any question on Twitter just don't defend shut up I'm sorry I see that it's just me Lois gotten the whole thing whatever okay moving on roogey Okubo says do I really need both my kidneys you know what that's part of the whole area of like kidney transplantation we've heard of people donating kidneys to other people in need who have kidney failure technically one can survive with just one kidney if it's as long as this normally functioning really good question hope I have more questions like this at Haley Nesbitt one says why do I always get cramps or spasms in my full leg newly every day hashtag ouch hashtag doctor help no sleep for me that I would definitely get checked out leg pain or leg spasm can be due to a multitude of things instead of saying what those hundred things are you actually need to see a physician for that to determine is it neurological a nation in nature is an inner penological
