 hey guys it's CS Joseph four CS Joseph dot life tonight's video we're going to be completing the series that we have on the sixteen personality profiles of the sixteen archetypes according to Union analytical psychology tonight's type is the behind-the-scenes idealist informative responding control also known as the infp introverted intuitive feeling perceiving also known as the dreamer probably because they're in dreamland at all times I think that's why they got the dreamer I mean you know Joseph's coat of many colors sold in the slavery Bible story dreamer ask person yeah I think he was 9fp but seriously though definitely all about the daydreaming they're never not daydreaming their ideal little land so anyway ideal little dream land that is got my whiteboard here and we can go over that succinctly so the infp a very mysterious type I love the mystery and infps just like intps in a lot of ways are super cute I mean a lot of them have no fashion sense because Essie trickster let's be honest but as they gain an experience in their years they can start to gain a fashion sense over time especially since they're insecure about what other people think and because of that insecurity and combining with that experience all of a sudden they know how to dress themselves but I'm not just talking about visual cuteness I mean everything from their voice how warm they are and just how mysterio so they are all at the same time just they just bleed to you all over the place I mean sometimes I've been around some infp women I just die of cute over and over and over again I don't know why but that's just what happens at least to me but yeah INF peas are just they're fantastic philosophers they're absolutely about philosophy unless they're immature then it's more like ooh I'm the social justice warrior who's here to take the pennant or flag of feminism and stuff it down your throat repeatedly until you have nothing else to think except feminism and join my SJW crusade to bring social justice to the world I mean yeah until life hits them and then they grow up and realize that there's more to just being an sjw and really focus on developing a new kind of philosophy not one that is succumbing to the thrall of groupthink that'd be nice but infps because of their weakness of te inferior they are very insecure about how their people think of them and a lot of times they actually draw their sense of self-worth because of that insecurity it's it's because they really want people think highly of them and they want the status that the end to be the status symbol of people thinking highly of them I mean why else do infps go out of their way with their ESTJ subconscious to be like that ultimate college professor you know who's got a master's degree or a PhD because infps really want to be brilliant even though like they don't give a damn about having a sense of logic it's all just pure rationale in the INFP land but that's okay they can at least get the deployment that that the diploma that is kind of just like you know the Scarecrow and prove that hey I have a brain so you all have to respect me now and then I'll be this amazing professor at a college and regurgitate to you everything I've learned with the filter of my own personal philosophy to guide me throughout that process right yeah okay but to be fair though infps can actually become super mega brilliant with that and they can collect those reference points and create something completely original to be honest some of the best literature i've ever read was composed by infps and i am extremely thankful for that one of my probably my most favorite infp that actually exists is Robert Greene he wrote the 48 laws of power 50th law mastery the art of seduction [Music] the 50th law which by the way the 50th law in my opinion is his number one most important book but you have to read all of them basically if it was written by Robert Greene you should be reading it and if you're not I'm sorry but have some self-respect and read those books seriously I highly recommend it and no I'm not getting like some random compensation for this plug I would tell anyone to read Robert Greene because that's just the intelligent thing to do because he really had knows his stuff that si child is able to gather reference points similarly to SI hero like the ISTJ infps can actually become it's very similar to is TJ's and that they can be that walking library big Alexandria it's not as strong as the ISTJ because they're not doing it from the point of collecting knowledge for the sake of getting wisdom per se they're collecting knowledge for the sake of developing their personal philosophy by taking all of the other philosophies and they ever met choosing or cherry-picking the best pieces of that philosophy developing an entirely new original philosophy and then delivering it to everybody on a silver platter oftentimes if people are going to reject that silver platter they're gonna pull out their whip and kind of stuff it down their throats because that's just how people are going to respond to it with that ESTJ subconscious but it's never from like a negative intention it's because the INFP feels it's their moral duty to do so and quite frankly it really is it really is the INF B's moral duty where do they get that sense of moral duty well it comes from the fact that you know fi hero is all about morality they make decisions based on what they believe is good or bad they always know how they feel about everything and because they're behind the scenes they're like pretty silent so just when you're in the presence of an INFP just realize that they're always silently judging you and they'll never admit to it and if they do I mean at least they're sincere but the truth is they're always silently judging and you just have to know that they're Fi heroes they're judging you constantly always I mean they kind of walk around believing everyone around them is a bad person anyway because no one can really measure up to their AFI hero capability except maybe like an infj or an is fgfe parent somehow for some reason because fi critic allows them to pass FB nemesises reviewing stand for whatever reason maybe it's because they're holding themselves is this an insanely high level personal standard to try to be perfect and have perfection and then the infps well like I'm already perfect so I'm glad you're at least trying to be perfect and that means we can work together right yeah but but in all seriousness infps are fantastic because at least the infe can get that infj right in front of them or that is F J right from the FI Critic and just be like hey by the way your standard is so impossible maybe I could bring you back down to earth over here you know we're like the rest of us are and you can follow my standard and utilize my feelings as a standard with which you always know what your boundaries are because if I'm feeling bad about something you know something is wrong and you probably should change your behavior that's why fi critic really needs to have a strong IFP around and that's either isfp or with the ENFP Wow allergies are just crazy right now of course that's what you get when you film out you know with all the doors open and it's springtime hey oh well so anyway that's fi hero any parent is really awesome it allows them to reach out into the ether because it's very metaphysical having metaphysical conversations about the collective unconscious and the collective feature of man as we know it and what other people want whether people's features are what is our fate and knowing the fates of others and being able to predict the fate of others is awesome about the infp because they could literally see the entire system and they're afraid of the system because of te inferior and they could see where the system is going they do realize that our system is just going to lead to total collapse of everything humanity so they work tirelessly to avoid that by teaching others by developing their own personal core philosophy and parting that knowledge onto other people teaching it to them via there is CJ subconscious or there estjs subconscious so that there is proper social change remember an INFP is an idealist right they are responsible for bringing about positive social change not just for themselves but also for the world as we know it however the infp similarly to the ENFP when it comes to brain social change if the infp is an immature or if they're lazy because they can be super mega lazy because to them it's like and what's all about how I feel and it's all about whether I'm comfortable enough to do anything but if I'm not comfortable and if I'm not in the mood I'm not going to do it and that could take weeks okay yeah that's productive thank you and by the way while I'm walking out the door and slamming on your face I'm also gonna put up a silences you are worthless don't do that please infps it's very important that if you're watching this that you make sure that you don't get stuck in that si child si hero rut at least is fj's don't really suffer from that because as much because they're they are very aware of how other people feel about them in that regard but infps can get stuck in a rut in the same way an intp or an iced tea chai can because that si trial that si hero is all about trying to do everything it can to be comfortable and you got to get outside of your comfort zone it's a really big deal guys si child yeah they're very innocent about the things they want to taste and innocent about the things they want to experience and they just really want to receive sensation but if if an INFP like you know spare the rod spoil a child if an INFP is spoiled in their youth they'll grow up thinking that the world's you know that the world owes them that owes them pleasure or or or think oratory somebody does you know what I mean because they live in this dreamland an INFP is constantly daydreaming and in somewhere else in their mind at all times and they really really want to bring their adult reality to do as closely as possible that ideal dream world that they live and where everything is good and everyone thinks highly of them and no one's fate is going to end up destroying the world and they're having a good experience at all times they're their ideal dreamland the problem is is that their ideal dreamland has nothing to do with reality but they're constantly trying to bring it into reality and then when they don't are not able to bring it to reality they get disappointed and then they end up in their little si child rut and then they're no longer in the mood to do anything and they're too uncomfortable to do anything so then they just have inaction and then their entire world around them was completely falling apart as if they would know anything about that because se trickster is completely unaware of the physical environment so as the world around them crashes the INFP is just walking around being completely indifferent to it and it's like oh wait by the way mr. or miss INFP it's your fault because had you had a little bit more self-awareness but I'm very software I have si child fi hero okay well maybe if you had a little bit more external awareness but that's scary okay yes it is scary but just realize that you're a human being and there's other human beings in this world you know it's not about you right you know I'd be happy to make your dream land come true don't worry it sounds pretty fantastic but that's not how reality is and because we have this thing called the human did the human condition that I mean you can only really bring parts of your idealistic philosophy to life not the entire thing but I know that you will not have it will not be for a lack of trying and by all means try but don't get so disappointed when you're trying to bring it into reality that you end up doing nothing idleness is a big problem for infps so also is I don't want to say it's a primary problem it's a secondary problem like their primary problem I would say it would be potentially disloyalty actually infps end up you know they're there they had this thing where I'm so loyal to you and I hope you think and I and I keep everything organized for you and I always give you warning so something bad is going to happen so because I do this I have this corporate contract with you that since I'm doing all these things for you you allow me to basically sit on the couch and be on my phone all day or you know it's kinda it's kind of weird like that how they can do that that's more for the immature infps the more mature ones really understand what their duty is their loyalty understand their their personal responsibility and they literally make it happen and they make it happen for their children then it get happen for their their husbands and wives for their family they take it very seriously to the point where they can't even live with themselves if they are failing in that area the problem is an INFP has to be taught that that's not something that they arrive to on their own conclusion because if they're raised up in a spoiled environment because infps are insanely literal and they take things very literally that's because of te inferior and they don't really have that TI in them to actually verify things and they're more worried about how the people feel about them and how insecure about how other people think of them because of all those external judgments are really scary to an INFP they have a hard time acclimating to personal responsibility that's why I fear acing an INFP you need to really emphasize personal responsibility as soon as possible if you're an INFP watching this it didn't really have that and you are spoiled my condolences but luckily for you you can learn the four pillars of self-intimacy so you can learn how to properly love yourself because after having self-respect and loving yourself properly other people could actually love you then and that enables you to love others more on that later that's actually a series that's gonna be coming up very soon for the next human nerd area human nurture series but anyway so I NFB strive to be super good people super moral people they can see into the future they have precedence they know what other people want they can see where people are going they can look into the fates and futures of other human beings they can provide warnings for those things they can the word they prefer everything to be predictable to them because that's what makes comfortable makes them comfortable if something is unpredictable they shy away from it and that's why I enough peace are pretty shy especially new situations where they've never been involved or have any experience with their si child right so that they want it to be dictum all right so by making it predictable there's that extra sense of security and they're able to function the problem is is that if it's too predictable if it's too mundane they'll start there and I critic will start to lose interest and then they won't be in the mood to do anything and they'll get stuck in a rut so you have to force them out of their rut my problem is like if you're in a relationship with one and you're trying to force your infp spouse or lover out of their rut it's not gonna be good enough to just to tell them what you think of them you're going to have to bring in third or fourth or fifth parties a lot of sources because INFP secretly because of that ESTJ subconscious they're all about cite your sources you know just like an ISTJ would because remember and ISTJ is still an ST J right and esti J's are all about cite your sources right so when you're trying to deal with an INF being trying to get them to change force force it upon them make it their obligation but also make sure you have multiple people to back you up and take your side in that situation and present evidence to them so they realize oh crap all these people are thinking really low of me right now I should probably change so I can feel good about myself because obviously they don't think highly enough with me and all of a sudden the INFP starts changing and like valuing maturity for once and taking personal responsibility too you know and and that's meeting their needs and then also they have personal standards and then all of a sudden their personal boundaries and all sudden they have personal goals huh it's because it's their obligation but they're only going to be obligated unless they have the multiple reference points from multiple sources of information telling them all the same thing that they're in a rut and they need to change and that's the only way that that really works a lot of people disagree with me on that point but having known plenty of infps and having dated a few of them I can tell you for a fact that that's kind of how they are it's not a bad thing it doesn't make them inferior it just means that because of how literal they can be in receiving ideas and experiences it's important that you always have the data to back up anything you're presenting to them because remember they're constantly silently judging you and they valued their opinion over anyone elses and it'll be that way forever I'm sorry they're on AFP's they know how they feel about everything and nothing's really gonna change that unless you have reference points and data and sources to back it up so T inferior they're very insecure about losing their status if like they take a reputation very seriously and even though a lot of people accuse infps of being really nerdy they're just they're not they're more earthy and kind of more I don't want to say a cult but or Mysterio so even though I already said that already it's it's more of their just fringe I would say but that's not a bad thing because that gives them a really cool flavor that adds to culture in ways that most people don't understand and I know some infps that are actually really good at learning and mastering specific forms of art I know an INFP that paints I know an IFP that draws I know one who plays the cello and it's like wow how did you learn how to do that because the cello it's all about just how they feel and they are able to weave a pattern into the cello themselves because the pattern recognition of their any parent their si child is able to weave it from their own personal experience and how they feel it is exquisite there are and the same thing goes with piano players too it takes a lot of self-discipline to do that because they have si child infps when they're not in a rut they can absolutely practice the most amazing self-discipline it's just that sometimes they have to have the self discipline it to not be in a comfort right that's like super important and well good luck so that is the INFP ego so ENFJ unconscious or shadow fe nemesis they literally walk around worried that other people are bad and they are constantly worried about people being bad in fact they see society in general as bad because people in society are bad in general so society in general must be bad and that's why they seek that to fix it and prove it by developing their core philosophy teaching their philosophy other people for the purpose of increasing or causing better a catalyst for for positive change the infp isn't the executor though of social change they're more of the vision behind social change they're providing the vision and the infj is the one that executes sit in the same way the ENFJ would also be one that executes sit nfj czar for that executing of the vision the NFP czar for providing the vision of social change in that way and the NFP s can work together to that end provided they're not being selfish INFP is because they're fi hero and si child are often accused of being selfish and it it doesn't necessarily mean that they are actually selfish it's usually because they just lack experience they lack that social experience because even though there are very social creatures with being idealist and that they're people people it's it's it's because that they lack the experience there si child's at no proper social protocols and social requirements and social responsibilities because they're already very negative towards those things anyway because they see people who are being social yet the INFP already intrinsically believes that those people are bad so it's like okay well why am I supposed to like behave that way you know what I mean it's it's really weird how that works but if you can teach them you know proper social protocols this doesn't become a problem as much but they're still always going to have a negative slant towards people because the TE inferior instead insecurity causes them to agree with majority rule agree with groupthink in the long run and they end up having a lot of their thinking tacked on to groupthink things that they've read I mean they're they're not immune infps are not immune to misleading graphs or charts misleading data misleading reports they're they're not immune to lives of other people often times I've seen infps going the level in the way of ignorance in such a way well they will almost believe everything they hear on television and on news and articles it's really bad but that's why NF J's exist because the TI child TI inferior cuts through all the for them and helps the infp improve their moral stance on anything be it politics or a or sociology or philosophy specifically by logically breaking down those systems for the infp chewing them basically in regurgitating them in a logical format which allows t inferior to track with that level of thinking which causes them to behave more moral it actually increases their morality and makes them even more moral than they were before and they remember it which is awesome the point is the INFP can't do it all alone and infps really look at themselves as people that can do it all alone at least from a moral standpoint they view themselves already as good people why do they have to learn more to become gooder basically when you have to tell the INFP well the truth is is that your goodness is based on groupthink in a lot of cases and if you're not doing your own research because you're lazy and stuck in an SI child rut then you need to have some improvement there infps it takes them a lot to do self improvement because of anti critic because they see everyone else being irresponsible with what people want like they see people wanting the wrong things they will not allow themselves to want things because it's like if I do I'm going to want the wrong thing and even though an INFP is extremely loyal to people they can also be extremely non-committal and in some cases disloyal and that's a problem is because the virtue and vice of the infp is loyalty versus disloyalty and this is why it's it's anti critic it's ENFJ subconscious because ENFJ or unconscious ENFJ unconscious just naturally believes that everyone else is bad people and i don't want to be like them so i'm gonna do it my way and because there's no one that i believe is good like me then i'm not going to commit to them and this is why they end up with INF J's or enfjs because nfj to them are the people are like oh so thank god someone good like me someone that I can respect or someone that I could be loyal to finally but even then they can end up having doubts about those people because of ni critic and then their loyalty could be questioned however when they're loyal when they are loyal they are so diehard loyal that they could end up following those NF J's over a cliff because they just absolutely love them or absolutely respect them in such a way where they're they're so emotionally intertwined with those people that they just cannot let go and that's where they feel the most comfortable being so emotionally intertwined with those people not a bad thing that's just what works well for them it's one of the reasons why infj love language especially infj female well it's both technically it's both genders infj both genders their main love language is quality time they have to spend quality time and the INFP or ENFP are all about spending quality time more so the INFP with NF JS way more so the reason is because a starter type Z&F piece can kind of like start yeah we're gonna start on this quality time thing and then they get distracted it's like wow that just derailed nice quality time there but the nina feels like well that was an attempt but the infp will just automatically follow through with that quality time and they're constantly wanting to do where they're constantly having their nfj partner just do everything with them because they're interested in what the INFP is doing because they see the INFP on this giant philosophical crusade to change the world and they do I mean look at Robert Greene he literally changed the world no one is going to argue with that because he did with his with justice books like literally just as books of his lectures so definitely have some serious value there so si trickster um infps dropped things all the time they're not very aware of their physical environments can cause them to have super bad fashion cents but because they worry about how the people feel about them and they're afraid of what other people think of them they're willing to start using their si child to remember what is good in certain fashion times and bad and other times and because of that over time the INFP will develop their own sense of fashion whereas it the intp good luck that's probably not going to happen at all may absolutely have to have somebody else manage that for them but the infp over time can actually handle it on their own and they don't really have that issue which is awesome especially with how like cute they are and then you just die of cute any time you're around them I mean even the INFP males can be super mega cute it's like wow I mean I didn't even know you had that in you well actually I did and they're just they're just seeping cute all over the place and then eventually has to become more and more refined and more and more mature they're seeping status and knowledge and seeping just gives you the feeling or the or the thought that they're like extremely wise right and because of just how amazing they are their core inner philosophy and and you just you just want to learn that philosophy and you want to implement that philosophy cuz you're just like wow they're so immoral and they're so right about that why am I not doing that myself because they've been able to take that inter philosophy from all the reference points that they've ever learned and all their sources on top of mixing that with their inner dream world and then they take the idealism from their inner dream world that they live in coupled with all those reference points and able to create a new philosophy and share that with the world and then bring about social change for the world it is absolutely amazing and because they live in the whole history pizza itself first law off-time all that has happened before will happen again with their si child and their any parent there even to go further with that by developing a long lasting philosophy that will make sense and help protect the future of everyone that subscribes to it absolutely phenomenal I love INF peas that do that and they can do that definitely a philosophical way and they could do it very like as professors and they make great teachers and they're ENFJ unconscious is all about teaching so they have that Professor oral vibe going with their subconscious but they also have that mentor role going with their unconscious and they can just be this person who's able to almost teach anything anything that they are an expert anything that the INFP is specialized on because they are all about specializing and these idealistic ideas and their ideals specializing in their ideals that level specialization just allows them to be able to teach anyone they come into contact with anyone that is any parent willing to listen that is they're willing to listen they got them and they can definitely get that philosophy transferred and held and maintained and the other person so that person is continuing to be a culture carrier and a philosophy carrier for the sake of everything so and then there's good old TI demon watch out for that ti demon it like if you if you don't if you don't share what you what you think with the INFP if you don't give them feedback on their on on your thoughts and feedback on their feelings if you make them uncomfortable whatnot they will go straight-up ti demon and the hell they will craft a solution that will destroy you in the moment they will destroy your physical environment try breaking up with the 9fp you might find all of your stuff completely destroyed good luck you might find your tires popped on your car it can get really really bad I don't recommend it it's really it's really a problem you know so I recommend avoiding that as much as possible whenever you can so based on that so how do you how do you avoid that or how do you have a good relationship with them remember allow them to feel things and always ask them how they feel about everything because they always know how they feel about literally everything and doing that makes them feel loved and makes them feel respected always tell them what you want because if you don't they'll be left to guessing do not leave things up to interpretation to the infp because then they'll just revert to what's worked in the past and if you need something new from them you better tell them you want something because if not it will be really bad so a te inferior always tell them what you think but do not be so overly critical the INFP if you are overly critical the infp that's another way to cause them to become just loyal to you and nfj is especially they seem like like TI child of INF days they seem like they're not they can be overly critical but they can be and the infp although they can take the hits usually because si child they can still be really sensitive infps are these people who because of how sensitive they are in that way they could have a problem with that and they could cause them to become disloyal so don't do that always tell them what you think but don't overly criticize an INFP unless it's where you're considering ending the friendship or the relationship with them and you're putting everything on the line that absolutely criticise them with everything you've got because it might be your only chance to get them to listen to you because they're like rocks I mean they exist to weather any storm they're like literally that mountain hermit that's levitating over a still lake water at the bottom of the mountain and you're throwing rocks and the rocks are like not they're hitting the the hermit but they're just following the water and the hermit is still in his meditative trance and there's nothing you can do about it that is literally the INF be good luck you know so be careful make sure you always you have to be willing to criticize them but just don't do it too much the point where they end up having this horrible bad experience or they end up feeling bad about themselves because if you over criticize them then they will start criticizing you they will believe it's fair then to criticize you with their sense of ESTJ justice and their si child justice that it's fair to criticize you and they'll go is TP demon mode on you and your entire physical environment or you or your body will be damaged quickly I mean the nearest the nearest rock or stick or tool or axe or kitchen knife will be immediately grabbed just you know when they go demon mode you gotta be real careful I mean tires being popped with after breaking up with an INFP is a definite thing watch out for that be careful but if you're being sincere and making sense the sincerity with your with their any parent they know they should probably listen to you but the thing is also if you really really really absolutely have to criticize them and it's very serious and your concern that will have negative repercussions bring other people that share your thoughts on the subject the thoughts on the IFB where you have multiple people criticizing them at the same time in that moment there si show to realize that it is time I should change because they won't want to change they're not about what they want they're all about what they should do so you have to obligate them to change that's how you motivate 9fp you obligate them you don't ask them what they want asking them what they want is like putting that down a black hole good luck with FE nemesis always tell them how you feel at all times and and then by doing that they'll though and try to make sure that you're behaving and you know try to be good like they are but of course if you're like an Fe user you're you're locking in on how good they are and you're absorbing their morality into yourself so you can behave ethically so usually that's not a problem remember it is not about what they want obligate them to motivate them if you need them motivated you have to obligate them you have to give them an experience you have to force them you have to force an INFP and show them that if they do not change there will be consequences and you have to follow through because if you don't follow through the INFP will just outlast you because remember they can outlast any storm good luck but it also means that they could take a lot of heads and they have insane endurance and long-lasting ability and that is also amazing to see what infps can go through and still come out on top in the end as a trickster they have very little awareness of the physical environment sometimes they struggle they struggle with driving until they have enough si child data with a lot of experience then they become amazing drivers but you still have to be careful they could drop things and fashion sense can be inhibited in some cases but at least that si child with with te inferior can learn over time but it really needs to be coached sometimes on those visual things on anything on the outside of them the physical environment just doesn't mean anything to them the metaphysical environment is everything to them and that's why I Neff peas have really colored desks sometimes or their homes are really cluttered clutter could be everywhere so you have to make it their responsibility like a requirement an obligation for them to clean things otherwise everything can just get crazy because they're just so focused on their inner internal dreamland that's the real reality that we live in just doesn't mean anything to them so you have to watch out for that so remember an obviously ti demon as long as you're not being overly critical or make sure that if you are being critical you have data and facts to back it up and multiple sources and citations because that's really the only way that they're going to listen to you so also when they're inspired with te I forgot to mention they can be fantastic at financial management they can be fantastic at forex trading they can be fantastic at doing business it's is a wonder to be seen like I've seen some insane financial advisors that were like really successful really good and they were all infps I forgot to mention that so just be aware of that as well if they don't have experience in those areas do not let them touch the finances until they at least take some classes and get some experience and read some books and at that point they're good to go and you don't really have to worry about that anymore because that's like a child or like remembers everything forever and we'll bring up stuff 20 years later and you're like wow where did that come from but that's an INFP for you it's all about that core inner philosophy so if you're in a relationship with them help them bring that philosophy help mold and develop that philosophy in them and how bring that out of them to be shared with the world to make the world a better place because that's their purpose they are the dreamer after all so if you found this video educational and/or helpful please leave a like and a subscribe and support the channel that would be awesome and thank you for being with me on this 16 personality type profile in depth cover series and I'll be doing many more series I got an 8 another nature series focus on cognitive functions it's going to be short and that was another nurture series that's gonna be short and then we're gonna be diving into another sixteen personality series talking about the virtue and vice of each type as well as a bunch of your user requests keep the requests coming guys keep the comments coming if you have any questions I'll answer them if you have any infps who had and you know of their core inner philosophy by all means share in the comment section I love to it read it and comment on it so anyways with all that have a good night see you tomorrow
