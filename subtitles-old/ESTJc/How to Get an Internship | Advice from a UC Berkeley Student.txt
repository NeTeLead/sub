 hey guys so welcome back to my channel so today I want to talk about a topic that I felt was very relevant to probably a lot of my audience viewers and something that I myself have gone through personally in trouble with so yeah today I'm gonna be talking about how to get an internship so I now for a lot of people getting into chip seems like a really daunting task and something that's really scary so today I'm going to be talking about 10 steps they essentially need to follow to help you to get an engine so if you guys would like to know what the processes of getting an internship then please been watching step one is to start early I can't stress this enough it is so important to start early because the last thing you want to be doing is scrambling and really trying to figure out what you're gonna be doing during the summer win the school year is literally about to end yeah the last thing you want to do is procrastinate on something like this because it's so important and then I think actually might even take priority over school it's just important to start early because everyone else is going to be competing for the same spots there are only a certain number of spots available so it's really important for you to start over see if you at least get ahead of the game typically fall time is when the companies have their internship programs and their internship application out so depending on what I've worked on track you want to go to whether you want to image of your business chemistry computer science physics biology etc you should really figure out what kind of company that you want to work for and if you want to look for a larger company that make sure these apply and fall and spring time is there one more when startups have their internships available so typically springtime is for smaller companies fall time is for larger companies number to have a resume this is especially important because this is what you are going to be showing to the recruiters or the people on in the companies that are looking you know to find the next intern this is their first impression of you which is your resume for your resume you want to make sure you tailor it to the job in your mind pool for example if you're applying to a research position that has to do with biology or maybe chemistry you don't want on your application things like oh I was a dance champion you don't want things like oh I you know participate in this homeless shelter and I'll give it back like a look like those things are all great but oftentimes your resume needs to be sustained and it needs to have the most important information on there so a lot of these other things that you might have as extracurriculars could be fluff that can fill up your resume but it doesn't actually add anything to your resume and it does the show while you are a better candidate I think it's really important for you to put normally resumes first of all they should be only one page long and if you want one that no one really wants to read through it you know so should just page-long you really want to make sure that you have their most impressive accomplishments that relate to whatever job you want to get so let's say you want a computer science internship or software engineering internship you want to make sure that your top achievement has to do with maybe school projects or the research you've done or you know things they've created or whatever classes you take in and those are all things that are relevant to suffer engineering you don't want to put things like oh I was in another public that has nothing to do with the job thank you are seeking so make sure that the things that are on your resume are very relevant number three polish your LinkedIn so I'm not sure how many people look online when they are going through candidates but I know that companies do look at your social media and I simply did which is a professional network it's a professional version of Facebook for those of you don't know they did this very important for you to polish you should have a good professional photo I actually don't have that yet but I need to get along doing that you also want to make sure that you have all of your most up-to-date clubs classes that you take you whatever accomplishments you've done if you build anything if you've done other internships before if you've done research for anything put back on your LinkedIn and I think it's very important to update your LinkedIn because if you are for example a freshman in college it's okay to have things from high school but as you progress through college you really want to make sure that all those things of high school are kind of gone from your LinkedIn because it's kind of irrelevant you know high school you don't do much to prepare yourself for the internship in the real career world that's where so what you do during college so I would say by the time it's your sophomore year you really shouldn't have anything from high school on your resume or on your LinkedIn because nobody cares and it's like a lot of those times of what we've done in high school is very intermediate level and only when you start doing these in college it's when those things are more relevant to the workforce and more relevant to the depth of knowledge that you might experience in your potential internship which is why putting your most recent work on your LinkedIn is very important and it is also really important to make sure that everything on your Linkedin is formatted nicely up-to-date I think I'm not sure how important is how people endorse your skill personally I haven't gone around asking people to do that so I guess it's not that important but of course it's nice to have it whatever way you can help boost your LinkedIn social media presence I think is really good and really important number four figure out what kind of companies that you want to apply to and I say this because you don't want to apply to things without even knowing where you want applying to I think he should in general have a idea of what you're open to I understand that when you're first starting out as my profession or sophomore you're applying for an internship maybe you are open to let all different sized companies you know your own and you are okay with starting small size companies mid-sized companies or corporate enterprises you're okay with all of those and that is okay and that's fine I think that as you apply to more more internships as the progress of the years you should really hone down on what size and what kind of company that you want to work for number five figure out location so for a lot of people you know myself included I would never want to work anywhere in the middle in the middle of the United States for example you don't want to be on the far west class or even want to give a far east coast and even if from the parties because I'm not too keen on working somewhere like North Carolina South Carolina Florida Connecticut New Hampshire look I'm not too keen on working in those states and nothing in the middle of the u.s. nothing against those places it's just that it's too far from where what I've grown up with and yes well it's a good idea to get out of your comfort zone I don't want to be so far out of my comfort zone that I feel uncomfortable and I'm not happy with where I am over the summer so I think make sure that you apply to internships that are in locations where you would want to go is also really important but don't try for overseas internships like there are internships where they are located in Europe or in Asia and if you get those offers you're gonna have to go there do you really want to go there see that's really important we want to make sure that where you're applying to somewhere where you actually want to work and for me I was applying to a lot of software engineering internship jobs and so because I was applying for software engineering internships a lot of those just happened to be in New York or the Bay Area very few in LA and there were some in Seattle so those are pretty much where my options are limited and that works for me because those areas that I would enjoy that I would like to be in and so this summer I'm in New York and probably the only summer that I hope to be here next summer I hope to be back in the Bay Area because I me and humid weather just do not go together I can barely tolerate you whether I complain about the law and even run to wherever there's AC like yeah please can't doing this weather California it's just home and it's just more my type of mother or so yeah so hopefully next time I'll be in Bay Area but I New York fourth person obviously because I've never lived here for a while and together positive experience so yeah make sure that location of where you choose store and purchase is also really important number six where it's up by trips so for me I find it very helpful to apply on website such as LinkedIn or handshake I found very helpful for me to apply on website uses I found it very helpful for me to apply websites such as LinkedIn or handshake or angel list Angeles has more stuff for startups LinkedIn and she cut both I believe but they also have larger companies and of course if they're really big companies you can always apply on those websites like Google for example filling with a google.com slash careers or something like that a lot of websites often have got slash careers URL in which they show job off job opportunity that they currently have a course you have to sift through them and probably search for like internship positions so that you could have to look for than what they are just for summer and make sure you look at the requirements some of them are like oh you have to be a junior you have to be an incoming senior essentially or someone more like becoming junior or someone we have to have surgery EA etcetera they often requirements so those are the three websites I really recommend applying to of course the top of you know whatever company large company and their careers but for the most part I would say we did handshake and Angeles those are a good websites where you can just collect the would buy a whole bunch of number seven mass apply and I think that this is really important because especially if you are coming in with no experience like if you are a freshman or you are a sophomore you don't have that much experience sometimes you can't say oh I've done this previous internship before you know all you have are things that you learn in class in my class projects class labs whatever and so you have that much experience so that's why I'm saying it's important to not apply I personally approximated and I only applied to I think around 30 and a lot of people fight differently for some we're very confident in themselves and have like a lot of experience completely high GPAs know that they will get hired maybe apply for like I don't know like twenty to thirty thousand that I was that I was very late why I didn't apply to so many many opportunities were gone obviously but I think some people might find one twenty to thirty and I also the people who've applied three hundred to four with replaces so definitely mass apply it does not hurt at all to apply everywhere and I think applying everywhere of course it's like free to submit your resume and so I really think that's important to just spread yourself everywhere of course considering location and company size and all those things as well but appoint everywhere really doesn't hurt number eight cold messaging so this is a technique that I personally have not done but I know other interns who have done this method and and they are where they are now because they have cool message people so what does this mean so one of my friends actually they ping you like what kind of job they wanted so maybe they wanted for example they knew they wanted an engineering internship okay so micro intern actually he had wanted an internship at we work and so what he did was he went on LinkedIn typed in we work software engineer something that along those lines found a bunch of people and message them to record message something to say hey I'm really interested in Volvo blah this is my resume like do you know if you refer me to someone who can interview me or do you know if you refer me to someone so that I can apply for any internships or do you know any internships that are available that are relevant to what I'm looking for etc etc and and sometimes these people were respect to you and they will say oh I am unfortunately on my team I've got several people but I know this team they are so then they might sue link mites into another connection in which you will go talk to them and through these kinds of connections you can offer laminate the chips and you can often they'll sometimes directly just say hey let's just set up an interview you get interview you pass and then you got a trip sometimes it is that simple and it's about finding those great connections and even though you reach out to people who might not have availability for that particular internship then if I refer you to other people who are looking for interns and you might just fit the bill so that's why I'm saying again the person there can ask you what's your recipe again resume is the most important thing it is their first impression of you and it is so important for you to have that makes it say wow this person is pretty good like let's interview them let's try to see like what they're like and all sometimes an interviews not only is it a way to test your skill but it is also a way to see what kind of person you are and your personality and that's nothing typically shines through in video interviews and sometimes you have video interviews you have call interview sometimes they're like written interviews there's so many different kinds of interviews some different internship application processes have multiple different route it's all varying but again most important thing is definitely have a bomb-ass resume number nine what to expect so I think a lot of people myself included when I got into this internship application process initially I was quite Scourge because I applied to like you know twenty to thirty places majority of them don't get back to you okay and also the different company size of course that you reach out to a really large company they might have an automated process that says like oh we're not interested in you so obviously they would say it nicer or something something like oh just watch it silver like Oh at this time like we don't need you or like when they see that of course that's very nice that they even let you know that they don't want you other company just say nothing absolutely just ignore you sometimes many Missy resumes get discarded away sometimes the company sloths have completely already feel so they may be considering you anymore so there's a lot of varying reasons for why you might not get reached back to but I think it is okay for you to get a lobe attempt to rape people reach back like personally for me I collect around 30 and I think around nine to ten companies reaches back maybe a less intense less intense less than ten actually reach back saying hey you want to interview you because a lot of the times I you know you're competing amongst a lot of people there are of course going to be people who are better than you there are course going to be people who are worse than you that is just the truth so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get heard back from and if you get interviewed that's great okay and during this time while you're waiting companies to respond back to you I think it's really important to you know practice your skills hone your skills if you know that you're going to get a technical interview prepared a technical interview you know do practice problems drink with someone you know work together with other people who are applying for similar job with you are in work together on problems you know and do mock interviews together all those things I think they're really important while you're waiting for companies to get back to you start pairing before the interview process should you get an interview yeah so that's definitely something to know a lot of things pending on the kind of internship that you're getting you may get interviews that are in person they might fly you out to get internship then you might go through several rounds of internships you might go through just the behavioral interview in which they just ask questions about you know kind of person or what do you do for fun those kind of things just engage what kind of person more and if you're going to be someone who's fun and they want to work with no one wants to work with someone who's boring obviously so you might have those questions and you might have moves interviews and you also might have interviews that just test your skill level so they might ask you to solve some sort of problem you know and of course it's not gonna be industry related because that girl you aren't just a college student but they don't expect you should know the industry that's something that happens after college or have you had an interest before they're probably going to test you on something that is related to like school material that you might have learned in school something really basic but difficult enough then it will test and it will give them a bearing on how much you know yep so those are things that I think that you should expect definitely it definitely keep in mind that a lot of the times companies will not get back to you they will not reach out to you you will not get an interview from all of them and of course depending on how good you are you might not give an interview from any of them or you might get from Calabar or you might get interview from 20% of them it all berries but definitely don't be too hard on yourself because these companies have a lot of that things too you know you're not going to fly so remember that and last thing number 10 so let's say after you've gone through all your interviews you get an offer letter okay oftentimes these companies they will say okay here's your offer letter give five days to decide okay you buy often times you can't break contracts and of course I know people who sign to this contract state yes I will work for you over the summer and they had the break of the contract I want something a black bus isn't the company that much they're about but they signed a contract say oh yeah over three over the summer then another company that they interview from we got back to them and they say hey if you want you so that you might be oh but this company was better so but already contracted I'm already tied with contact to another company I'm just going to break that contract that you know silence other company I know people love them nap I'm not saying it's the most morally ethical thing to do but people do it of course like okay we'll do it another thing is that you've money people to have a leverage like let's say you some companies give you will give you thirty days so we'll give you two weeks to respond and during those two weeks or thirty days you get off letters from other companies and they say oh you only have five days for us oh you only have like a week for us well what you can't do sometimes is use those other companies and those other operators that you've got as leverage or you can often make a deal with other companies saying hey I got other really competitive offers from these other companies can you give me a few more days to decide and that is something that companies might think oh wow this girls wanted a lot you know like we're going to make sure that she has more time to decide or whatever some companies might still be strict nursing oh those only have these days and we're not changing it don't be afraid to reach out companies just because you're an intern does not mean they give us the power to ask for a little bit of you know room to negotiate I think negotiation is important don't let a company intimidate you it's just some do make sure you read the contacts you read those contracts like I ain't cancer setting up that is really important the fine print whatever they say I'm known so easy to just quickly sign things that you agree to things but then like what happens if like something happens and you're like oh like goodbye dude agree to this but they're going yeah you didn't like people the contract you signed it so I think especially if you're crying for a job and you are agreed to this contract is really important to read the fine print Penza yeah so those are my 10 tips on how to get an internship I hope this video is helpful for you guys and let me know down
