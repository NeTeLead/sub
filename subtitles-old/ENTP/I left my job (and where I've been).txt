 that's bright alright let's do this thing hey everyone how's it going long time no see it's been a hot minute since I posted my last video which probably was like a month or a month and a half ago I hope YouTube surfaces this video for y'all cuz I am NOT friends with the algorithm right now and I think it's hurting me but you know whatever it's not even about the numbers so either way it is good to be back and I am excited to tell you kind of what's been going on and I'm guessing that you clicked on this video because you wanted to know about all of this where do I even like start for this okay so I left my job at patreon on October 12 so yes that was over two months ago now and I kind of wanted to talk about why and what's been going through my mind the last two to three months I don't know I guess I don't I don't owe this to anyone but I I just really wanted to talk about it because why not this is my creative outlet I want to be able to talk about stuff okay so this is one of those videos it's just like oh I left my software engineering job and I completely understand how much of a place of privilege that I come from to be able to leave a job like that and also have the option to do all the things that I've been doing basically so I completely understand and I know that I am so fortunate to be in this position so let me start off saying that just wanted to put that out there. so I go to therapy I have been going to therapy for I think about two years now and I first started going because I had anxiety and panic attacks and stuff and I was so sick of feeling so anxious all the time so that's what started it since then I have gotten over a lot of my anxiety and panic attacks stuff thank God and I started going just to kind of talk to someone about my feelings and my thoughts which has been the most useful thing so my current therapist I started going to her because I was like hey I think that the thing that is missing from my life right now that is not allowing me to reach my goals is discipline it's funny because through a lot of sessions and stuff I realized I was like so wrong and thinking about that I mean I think I do like lack discipline in some things obviously but that was not the true thing that I needed to think about and work on so one of the exercises that my therapist gave me is to draw out literally visualize what kind of life do I want to live in the future so talking about it with my therapist and kind of thinking about what I drew that day it made me really reflect on what do I want in life and how am I going to get there I really like being able to spend an hour or not thinking about the time and drinking a cup of tea and really enjoying how good like milk teas or just like sitting down and listening to music or just appreciating my dogs company like these are all things that I really like to do I'm an over-thinker I'm also an over feeler and so I really enjoy the time that I get to kind of just put life on pause and basically process everything which I know I've talked about in a lot of videos but really that's really important to me among other things I really like being able to be productive and feel like I'm useful and kick ass at something like those those are also feelings that I really like chasing too and in order to do all of those things and live the life that I want I really need to be good at managing my intake of the world and also my out take my output of the world as well because if I input too much then I literally have so much to process and if I output too much I'm literally just too exhausted to even input anything into my brain anyway this is really abstract and I'm sure if this it's like none of this makes sense but it did really make me reflect on you know what do I want what kind of life do I want to live and when I compares what I wanted in life to the life that I was actually living it was a lot of input and a lot of output and not enough time to process anything I was trying to make every single minute of my life super productive and worthy and I wasn't wasting any time and that's like the complete opposite of what kind of I wanted to do which makes sense right like most people are like hey let's figure out how to be the most productive person you can be let's make sure that you are quantifying your stuff against your goals like that's totally fine like that works for some people and great like you found the system that works for you I think I had tried that and I did oh I did a lot of that like mental calculation and it was honestly just really exhausting for me and so I realized like tangibly the things that I needed in life was a lot more flexibility in terms of flexibility in the time that I had or flexibility to feel things in the moment or flexibility to I don't know kind of make decisions on my own that best suited my needs I really just really just needed to slow down like a lot so how this all ties back into like why I left patreon is cuz I feel like I hit a breaking point where I realized that working there wasn't going to give me the time and flexibility and the kind of life that I really wanted it took me a long time to figure that out because patreon was my dream job like I loved working there like that still doesn't change even after I have moved on but the things that I really liked about the job and the actual execution of like what it is to work at that job were two different things and I was constantly managing my relationship with work at this point I spent like three hours a day commuting to and from my work which I did the math I have spent three months in total commuting to and from patreon during my time there which like that's so much time I mean I was really sad to leave that job though cuz it was my dream job like I said I really still personally aligned with the mission that they're going after and I am and was still so passionate about being a part of that and wanting to do good in the world by creators and their fans I mean I was able to realize kind of like this lifelong goal that I had of starting a YouTube channel while at patreon because I was surrounded by so many great creative people and really motivated and awesome passionate people who were really interested in the arts and I learned so much as a software engineer and as a person I got to me and work with so many incredible individuals there that I totally would have been like a completely different person and had I not worked there so I am so truly grateful for the time that I had there which was two and a half years and yeah it was so hard leaving honestly like I it felt like a breakup I'm still a little bit sad to be honest and as tough as it was I am so glad to work there and I think it was the right decision for me to leave so after I left I took six weeks off which I am so lucky and glad that I did because I took six weeks just to kind of decompress between jobs and it was nice I felt like I was on like summer vacation again and I really got a lot of time to myself which was kind of making up for lost time honestly you know I was like commuting so freaking much I didn't really do like a whole lot during my six weeks I honestly just hung out and like decompressed did like chores and stuff that I had been wanting to do for a while like this whole dining room behind me I did turn my six weeks off because I just wanted to make my home feel more comfy and cozy me and I slept a lot and I can't and it was such a good time and during this time I didn't make any videos because one of the things that I think was kind of a I don't know like a source of pressure or stress for me during this whole thing was I felt like I needed to make videos because I had to like if I didn't like something bad would happen and it became this thing that I had to do instead of something that I wanted to do and so the creativity wasn't flowing and I was not really having fun so I decided to just put a pause on it for now that's why there haven't really been any videos so I'm sorry but it was so helpful because now I feel like my creative juices are flowing again and I feel motivated and excited and I feel like I want to make videos again so it was time well spent I feel mentally emotionally physically like my body and everything was just relaxing and it was so needed so after my six weeks I did start a new job and I am really enjoying it my commute is so much shorter it's like 20 minutes one way so nowhere near how long I was commuting to go to patreon and I feel so much more balanced in all of the ways that said I don't necessarily feel like I have all the answers yeah and I'm not like completely like I'm not a completely self actualized human being honestly it's all a process but I how I do feel like I've caught up to my feelings and my thoughts a little bit more and I feel like I can work through them better and I feel like I'm a better person I feel like I'm truer to myself I don't know it might be very like American for me to be like live your truth but I think that's an important thing to do like we only get so much time on this earth so you know live your truth as best as you can so yeah that's where I've been for like the last two months and sorry that I haven't been making videos I kind of just been taking time to myself and I don't know what making videos is going to look like in the future but I do have ideas brewing and I'm just hoping it can convert those ideas into actual videos execute on them but if there are types of videos that you really want to see that maybe I've done one of before maybe I've done none of leave a comment down below to let me know what types of videos you want to see more of okay well that's it I guess how do I do this again like this video and like subscribe or something okay I think that's it for today so I'll see you next time bye I left my job at patreon out then why do you bite me.
