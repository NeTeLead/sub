 so after one of my sessions the other side said Christine take out a pen we want you to write a video about something that came up in this reading and it's all about the law of attraction as you guys know self-love is the highest virtue I have many videos about self-love because it actually comes above unconditional love for others because once you've mastered the art of unconditional love for others it's up to you to balance that with self love and to temper it so it's a judgment call that needs to be made in each individual situation and circumstance so the law of attraction responds to self love a lot when you exercise self-love you basically tell the universe I love myself and so should you so that's why little things that you can do throughout the day such as buy yourself flowers read a good book go see a comedy whatever you can do to reward yourself for your accomplishments Pat's on the back controlling your thoughts self complimenting wow you know you really kicked butt in that business meeting good for you beat up that critical inner voice and get rid of it and replace it with complementing cuz that'll boost your personal power and your self-esteem throughout the day now dots and emotions are energy so you're also broadcasting a signal right I'm treating myself well so should the universe because I'm worth it so that is what you are setting your magnet to attract to yourself okay now here's why the other side asked me to make this video right what happens when that balance between unconditional love for others and self-love is out of balance it's uneven it's tilted too much towards unconditional love for others as opposed to self-love it's not being tempered with that judgment well let's start with certain situations shall we the martyr martyr syndrome the Bible has a lot about this doesn't it unconditional love for others service let me just bend over backwards and forwards and be your servant because unconditional love for others is applauded good for you you're so selfless you're so selfless you really really help that person well that's great that's fantastic and we should be helping each other cuz my other videos are all about the collective consciousness and your life purpose and speaking your truth and being who you're meant to be and helping others with your god-given gifts and talents right but when you take that too far and you extend yourself too much in trying to be the martyr in a family situation just like oh I'll do it I'll do it at your own expense what happens you adopt a victim mentality and you start wallowing in self-pity and you start saying poor me poor me poor me and that victim mentality completely robs you of your personal power personal powers gone out the window and then the law of attraction responds to that victim mentality oh yeah poor you and then you start attracting crap to yourself because you see yourself as a powerless victim and you just melt now what's the opposite of that the opposite of that is gratitude what are you grateful for write down a list because then that triggers you know personal empowerment and feeling blessed and a sense of appreciation that the universe then responds to and starts bringing you more abundance because you're grateful for the abundance that it's brought on to your path so do you see how energetically the martyr system when you take it too far you end up demonstrating a lack of self-love and the universe responds to that lack of self-love and the law of attraction is actually really sensitive to that virtue to be honest like with my ass every folks I totally caused it by drinking too much coffee and tea so karma was out of balance I brought this you know medical condition on myself I was like self-love I'm like running into you know the grocery store just like grabbing all these flowers so fun by myself flowers yay Christine because I know how the universe responds to decisions base and self love however small so I'm just saying I'll do like little tricks like that what I know I've attracted darkness to myself I'll turn it around with small acts of self-love that's how powerful it is it's like the universe is this tracking device how much do you love yourself now I'm not asking you guys to be selfish but I'm just saying there's a balance between self-love and selfish also self-love isn't supported by society so call you selfish don't judge you maybe that's why it's the highest virtue because the hardest one to obtain and actually stick to because you're kind of marching to the beat of your on drumming going your own way and risking judgment in the process oh you're not a good person you didn't do that it's like well decisions based and self-love are always supported by Universal energy to remember that so just make sure your decision is based in self-love but the martyr the martyr syndrome is incorrect so please throw that out the window that whole I'm your servant I'm your slave thing no you're really not you're really no one servant you're really no one slave you know even how they made a video called are you rescuing your partner case in point the other side holds each individual accountable for their own life their own behavior their own happiness because they manifest and create their own worlds so the if the other sign is we'll leave these people accountable you have to hold them accountable so you end up enabling them you end up weakening them if you help somebody too much you you you know take away their personal power by doing stuff for them so you're you end up hurting yourself and others sometimes when you try to be the martyr so you know another thing is is people try to be the martyr at work I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it are you just trying to show off is that coming from a place of eco and just trying to show up make sure your intentions are pure if you're offering to do something make sure your intentions are pure I'm just saying because you attract darkness to yourself that way too so yeah you know like the type-a personality where somebody when when I was in the corporate world somebody took a cartoon and wrote Miss Pavlina does not take sick days and it was an image of a girl walking into work with an IV and they stuck it on my desk and they were making a statement about me being type-a and I was proud of it when I got that cartoon I was like yeah that's pretty it's pretty accurate that's pretty dead-on thank you ho ho ho and I actually ended up hanging that in my queue and now if somebody gave me that I'd be like don't tell me that about myself I don't want to know that I don't want to know that myself love is so weak that I won't take a sick day if I need one cuz you only attract darkness to yourself I'm not worth it I'm not worth it I'm not worth taking a sick day and potentially disappointing people and potentially having my work pile up or having my co-workers cover for me and you know asking them to do stuff for me because I'm not worth it I'm not worth it you are worth it make those waves because it's so fun and you are attracting positive energy to your soul via the law of attraction if you do take that sick day because it's your truth if your truth is you're sick you're embracing your truth so you're so you're aligning yourself at the truth and the light so being sick becomes your truth that's really what it is that's why the law of attraction rewards you so along those same lines another issue with this is just plain old people-pleasing and we do this all the time why do we try to people please it's because we don't really love or accept ourselves we need to get that love and acceptance from somebody else so we're constantly trying to please them so that we can feed off of that approval that is our ego needing that what is our ego need because we're not giving that to ourselves we're not doing a good job of getting that to ourselves what's a good example of this my parents want me to be a doctor or lawyer so I guess I better make them happy you know they're paying for all the schooling bobba it's not my life purpose my life purpose is I really want to be an artist but they told me I'm gonna starve so I'm just gonna pursue the doctor the lawyer path even though it's not my life purpose or my heart focused work people-pleasing lack of self-love because you're not worth standing up for you're not worth making waves for because you could potentially piss off your parents so lack of self-love you're not worth it so you just told the universe you're not worth it so not only that you're not aligned with your truth because your truth is to be an artist you're steering away from the truth towards something else so law of attraction nightmare that's how you attract see how easy it is to attract darkness to yourself isn't this fun what can I say it really is Star Wars so another thing is I'm trying to think of like well I mean you guys know what people-pleasing is I mean you get it you know this is another thing is if you try to please people too much you end up compromising your own wants needs and desires and so that's why the other side is really big on journaling so that you are in touch with your wants needs and desires so that you can manifest them but also a lot of times if you're really focused on pleasing others and satisfying them you lose touch with yourself you don't really know what you want or need you don't really know what your hobbies are you know maybe you know you're working so much you've lost touch with your hobbies because you haven't had time for them all right you have other priorities so just think balance balance um another thing is is if you're typing and you work a lot you do get a sense of accomplishment from that because if you're really really hard on yourself you're gonna feel really good if you put in that extra long day but then if you skip the gym your body's a temple so you're not taking care of your health then you attract more negative energy to yourself so I don't know it's almost like logically your logical brain is mentally rewarding yourself for working long hours and really stepping up to the plate at work and getting the kudos from that boss but then the universe is like no what about the gym what about your cardiovascular health you're stressed you need to balance that stress with exercise and endorphins and a healthy diet also you've been stressed out so your body's releasing cortisol so you're gaining weight from the stress and also you need convenience food so you're grabbing fast food so you're eating crap and you're not eating healthy food so the universe are some ones are there down the toilet law of attraction yeah like I said this is a lot of fun another thing that people do in personal relationships is they just compromise too much you just let your partner take the wheel and you just become a doormat you're like well I'm not worth making waves over so I'm just gonna keep compromising to avoid any sort of you know scuffle you're worth making a ruckus over don't compromise again sometimes you have to walk away from an argument to try to figure out how you feel about it that's fine take the time away from your partner and say I have to get in touch with how I feel let me get back to you and then you come forward and say okay this is what I need and this is what I want and it's kind of like what is your relationship with your own needs or your needs important enough to communicate because your needs or your truth so you do know your needs you do know your truth your truck darkness tears I was just like I feel like you know have like an audience here say with me you attract darkness dear self we are all superheroes that's why it's my tagline we are all superheroes they are battling evil the angel on one shoulder mm yeah demon on the other whatever there is no devil so yeah just make sure you're not compromising too much okay you're worth it if somebody bothers you speak up you're worth it your partner is not a mind-reader. alright so another thing that's really fun that I was mentioning earlier is I was talking about whether or not you're aligned with truth right well what about the big truth I'm a psychic medium Mike Karen think I'm nuts they'd rather me shut the hell up and go back to the corporate world are you gay and you don't want to come out of the closet because you're gonna bear us the hell out of your parents oh well let's just stay in the closet and make our parents happy cuz we don't want to embarrass them well your parents are embarrassed that's their ego light doesn't care about their ego the light doesn't care about people pleasing your parents they care about truth and if being gay is your truth you have to speak it so you attract darkness to yourself by not speaking your truth are you supposed to be a professional tarot card reader and you're not doing it cuz people are gonna think you're weird that's your ego you just attracted darkness to yourself because it's your life purpose your truth and you're not aligned with it the universe is a very unforgiving referee you pursuing your life purpose and your truth that's the light that's the light you pursuing that is a decision based in self love I love myself so much that I'm going to be true to myself embrace all of my god-given gifts and talents and embrace my truth and let the world know I'm gay and then after that the world know I'm gay I'm gonna let everyone know that I'm gonna help others come out of the closet I'm gonna try to help others align themselves with truth see how that works woo you just made yourself a plump and juicy magnet for a wonderful and amazing abundance to come on to your path with that one because not only did you speak your truth you're helping align others with theirs that's some good stuff right there um okay so that's that's what one of the things that they are saying is I. was recently speaking with a grandmother whose grandson came out to her and she was totally cool you know loving supportive you speak your truth you be here gonna be but she hid the fact that he was gay from all of her friends she didn't want them to know and she's a God that generation you know our generation you know they're really close minded that's not gonna happen Christine and I kept my mouth shut but what I was thinking was well then I guess those aren't really your friends are they they're not she's hiding the fact that her grandson is gay because she's she doesn't to deal with it we want to deal with it don't want to deal with the judgment the opinion like what I'm looking at her differently number one that's her ego number two her friendships aren't really authentic are they so I challenge you if people don't know who you really are those friendships are totally 111 percent fake you can consider that a totally fake friend because they have no idea who you are what your truth is. that's how you sift through the most amazing friendships and I think that's what makes my friendships so special to me is they know who I am I'm really far out there and they're still my friend so god bless him god bless him those friendships are even more meaningful to me see how that works and they'll be more meaningful to you because they know what your truth is and they love you they love you for your truth they respect you for your truth they respect you for speaking your truth they're right there next to you supporting you so yeah I actually ended up feeling sorry for that grandmother I was like huh your friendships are obvious if you can't tell them that your grandsons K all right another thing this is actually really interesting and it kind of freaked me out because it was something that didn't occur to me well sorry occur to me I can't take credit for this it was something that wasn't shown to me by the other side until recently suppose you're a fireman and you're rescuing people all day every day you're a hero so obviously you attract positive energy to yourself by saving lives what happened when you take that too far right again unconditional love for others self-love what happens when you take that too far and you start taking unnecessary risks and you start breaking the protocol that firemen have and taking these unnecessaries to save people's lives but it was a judgment call that had to be made and you your judgement was like way far out there like whoa you like seriously could have died we can't believe you did that so as a hero as a fireman you stick out from all the other firemen and maybe that's what you're thinking as you're saving this person you're like I'm gonna stick out from the rest of these you know Yahoo's see you going you do that what was that driven by that was driven by your ego and what did you do you showed a lack of self-love because you overdid you didn't keep that balance that judgment of saving people you went too far out there you end up attracting darkness to yourself because you had impure intentions your intention was driven by your ego so you attracted darkness to yourself and that was one of the things that really freaked me out because they showed me a true hero and someone that I really respect became a law of attraction nightmare because of that yeah pretty pretty weird huh so there's the difference between being a hero and then just total lack of self-love and just ego driven behavior so yeah I thought that was really interesting and just something that was shown to me recently and kind of freaked me out I mean it makes sense I mean it makes sense of the law of attraction but it's kind of an eye opener like wow you could even be too much of a hero crazy cuz you figure if you're saving a life you're saving a life but they can see the universe can see you're intense so make sure it's pure um so another thing I guess that's that was really what they wanted me to stress is like the last thing they really wanted me to just remind you guys of is just the importance of balance everything in balance again it's that's what you ask yourself is is this decision based in self-love that's what you ask yourself that's this really the litmus test and you know if you're making decisions based in self-love you're feeding yourself you're giving yourself what you need so you are powerful and you do have more energy some of you think about it if you give yourself more self-love you technically do have more energy to help others anyway because you're feeding yourself so your own built up with this energy to go out there and help people so you are putting gas in your tank via your decisions based on self-love so I can see you are better able to serve the collective consciousness the better you treat yourself so it benefits the collective if you treat yourself well but um you know that's that's really the thing is be honest with yourself and others make sure your intentions are pure and make sure if you feel spent or put out that you pay close attention to that because that's when you're going to victim mentality like I said and then you get resentment you preserve resentful or angry really okay now I feel like I'm just being taken advantage of you know that whole saying you give him an inch they take a mile you know you know just make sure you've got those firm boundaries where it's like okay I'm gonna do this this and this but then that's you know that's it time parameters you know whatever you want to put on it because at the end of the day the law of attraction can be your best friend or your worst enemy so the other side wanted me to make this video letting you know how to make universal energies your best friend in order to support and guide you on your path encircled in love and light and in the meantime take care ends be well thank you
