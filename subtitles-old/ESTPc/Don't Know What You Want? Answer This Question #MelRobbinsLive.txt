 hey everybody I got a great question for Morgan and she writes with a question that we get asked all the time and that question is what do you suggest Mel for accessing what you really want you know I talk a lot about being honest with yourself about what you want and if you're somebody that's watching this and you have no clue what you want I'm going to say that's total I think you've probably decided that either you can't have it because you don't think you're smart enough or good enough or worthy enough or maybe you think you're too old or you've told yourself that you can't make a living doing it both are complete and utter lies that you're telling yourself what you need to do is ask yourself this if you took money off the table if you didn't get a what anybody else thought what's the thing you would love to be doing with your life seriously do you dream of being a professional photographer you want to open your own restaurant you always thought about traveling the world and entertaining kids with your juggling skills I don't know it's your life you get to choose what you want to do be honest with yourself what is it that you would want to do with your life if you didn't have to pay the bills doing it another thing you can ask yourself who do you find yourself sort of envious of you know like you look at their life and you just think gosh how awesome that they get to do that well once you have that answer for yourself you've gotten really honest you push the aside and you've really asked it for yourself and answered the question honestly all you got to do is explore it that's it just find one thing that you can do to enrich and expand your knowledge about it find one course online Google the topic stalk people that are pursuing this line of work that's how you start to do it one step at a time so start with answering the question what do you really want with a massive dose of honesty Google the topic and find one thing that you can do just one push yourself and start to explore if you were to wake up and do that every single day spend 10 minutes day you would be startled astonished by what your life looks like in a matter of a year or two [Music]
