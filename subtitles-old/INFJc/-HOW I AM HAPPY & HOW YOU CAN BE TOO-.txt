 every day I'm asked by at least one person how and why I am so happy and this question always confuses me because weren't you meant to be asking yourself how and why you're not as happy as me why is this so rare to be genuinely happy with yourself and with your life why is it so rare I went on tumblr yesterday for the first time in a long long time usually I just upload a photo get out of the app but yesterday I was laying in bed and I was just scrolling through tumblr and I came across a lot of posts that made out depression and anxiety and feeling sad to be funny and to be relatable and to be cool and just so you know what I mean I screenshot interview one of the posts that caught my attention has million and 400,000 notes and it's saying a 90's kid don't you mean sad adult another post with a million and 200,000 notes becoming older than 10 years old was the biggest mistake of my life and out of post with 16,000 notes get my look depression $0 another post after literally anything that happens to me me I want to die not that I don't have a sense of humor I get it it's funny because it's relevant but what the yay may help people realize that they're not the only ones feeling that way and I'm all for that the problem I have with that is the amount of posts that are about depression and anxiety it's making it look normal people are laughing in them and they're like oh my god yes that's so me and what pisses me off about this humor is it makes it seem like it's completely normal and everyone has it and yeah and it just it doesn't it doesn't push you to get over it you should never feel like it's normal like you are supposed to feel that way that is not normal and you can change it's not cool it's not cool to feel that way and I try to compare how I'm feeling about my life and about my situation with others who are not as happy as me and I tried to figure out why is it so rare to be happy in a way do I feel happy and I did think of a few points that are possibly the reason I am so content and I'm so happy and they can definitely help you the first thing I want to talk about is don't dwell on things life is too short I'm sorry to break it to you and I'm sorry to be all dark but you're gonna die one day and why dwell on things and hold grudges and if something sad happens keep thinking about that sad thing like dwelling on things will not change anything about what happened it will just waste your time it will literally waste your time bring you down if you're dwelling on something right now whatever happened that is stopping you from feeling your best forgive and forget forgive someone else or forgive yourself and forget because thinking about it over and over again will not change it and will only make you feel worse and will waste your time like you can literally do so much more with your time imagine if you just let go of every worry and of every concern you're not in control off and spent that time actually doing something that you love spending that time and self-development spending on time on the cheating of goals second point I'd like to talk about is don't take life so seriously compared to like the global Universal scale of everything you're literally like a little bacterial microbe on this blue bowl of atoms what the just imagine plant earth spinning slowly in this nothingness and you are there on earth too worried about getting about great or the fact that he didn't text you like what your problems are not that serious most of the time we worry about the smallest things they're not that important - you're way too time like I said in my first point you can do so much more with your time if you just let go don't take life so seriously like he didn't text you oh my god okay move on it's not a big deal nothing is a big deal next point that really helped me realize my power and help me on my path to happiness is realizing that I'm in control of my own life you're in control of your own life you can do anything honestly think about it what is stopping you from doing what you love what is stopping you from being happy it's you it's only you and if you think that it's something else it's not that it's your perception of that basically it's you it's still you right now you are stopping yourself from doing what you love why I don't know you have to figure it out make things happen you're in control of your own life you can create your own life you can do whatever you want you can do it I'm happy I am genuinely happy when I say I'm happy I don't mean that I never feel sad never feel angry now I feel annoyed I do you feel those things but I don't focus on them I don't let them take over my whole mindset of what life should be like I do feel those things but overall I am happy I am so happy I am in love with everything and ever look for the positives write a list right now like pause this video write a list of what you don't like about your life right now what makes you unhappy about your life right now and then write how it can be a good thing so for example if not enjoying school right now you can write I am NOT enjoying school right now but I have friends there that I can talk to every day if you don't like your job you can say I hate my job but I can earn money to do what I want and spend them on what I want and I can quit my job anytime and do some thing better because you can there's always a better option I can't say I was always this happy I found my dearest out the day from like 2012 2013-14 and I was reading them and I was just like holy I didn't realize how sad and miserable I felt all these years and I will be uploading a separate video about my spiritual journey through diary entries because I was trying to figure out where what was the point when I really changed my outlook and I came to realize that my journey it all began when I went vegan so that brings me to my next point which is good diet lots of sunshine lots of time outside and practice spirituality so meditation yoga take care of yourself basically that's what it is take care of yourself take care of yourself physically take care of yourself mentally emotionally spiritually a few friends of mine work every single day like 9 to 5 hours and they don't have time to nourish themselves they don't have time to eat properly they don't have time to do anything but work and that's what makes them unhappy by the end of this video I want you to figure out what makes you unhappy and how you can change it how you can take control of your life change what makes you unhappy and do the opposite do what makes you happy bigger yourself out please it shouldn't be rare to be happy it shouldn't be rare to be generally happy and it shouldn't be funny or normal or cool to feel sad and anxious and lonely and depressed it's not normal it's not normal please let this video to be the beginning of your journey to happiness I want you to be happy and I want you to take charge of your own life forgive let go don't dwell on things don't take life so seriously you are amazing and you do so many things and go do them right now
