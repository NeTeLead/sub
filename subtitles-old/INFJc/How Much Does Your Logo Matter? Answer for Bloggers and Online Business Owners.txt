 should remove my gum good night yeah focus on me what about me cool what's going on guys welcome to another video with create and go my name is Alex Nerney and we're gonna talk today about if your logo actually matters when it comes to blogging today's video I want to be a little bit different because normally our videos are like 15 20 minutes but but it can be answered in like a really short amount of time so I just want to go ahead and answer this question the reason why I'm bring this up is because I saw it back in our private support and community group somebody asked us how much does your logo really matter and there are a bunch of answers from yeah of course it does look at all these massive companies where their logo does matter and then some other people saying no it doesn't at all and I wanted to give you our answer to this question the easy way for me to actually give you this answer is to just talk about our experience with it the first blog that we had successful as many of you know is our health and wellness blog called avocado com avocado is really designed as like a health and weight loss website for women for those of you that don't know we took that website to making over 20 grand per month where it currently sits today and just so you know we have never ever designed any sort of logo for that website in fact I think that Lauren just found me the font that we use just found a cool font called trash hand online wrote out the words avocado turned it into a PNG and that has been our logo ever since so it's gonna be hard for me to sit here and tell you that your logo matters when we didn't need it to take our blog to making over you know 200 grand per year the same goes to create and go create and goes started the same thing same exact logo same font for a while again the reason was is I mean we're already successful without using a logo why would we go and get a logo right well now today we actually have a logo designed and you'll notice that it's not really complicated at all I think it's just it's a nice put font with like even just a little arrow at the creating go mark I think it's important for me to address this because I went to business school at Arkansas and it was the Sam Walton school of business so the Walmart essential School of Business and there it was taught to me like it has probably been taught to you and ingrained in your brain that logos matter that your branding really really matters and I gotta say it they're just kind of wrong it's not that branding doesn't matter it's that people start with branding and that's the mistake as there are so many steps so many hurdles in your journey to being successful online and I got to tell you this step of getting down an amazing logo is way way way far out in your journey you need to first figure out how to write great blog posts you need to figure out how to create an amazing product how to sell affiliate products how to get good at email marketing how to create amazing sales pages that actually convert people from visitors to customers these things are infinitely more important than having a great logo only once you have solved all of these problems and more should you ever even think are consider getting some sort of high quality are amazing designed logo as far as big companies using branding like people refer to Apple you know if McDonald's they have iconic logos guys they didn't have iconic logos until they were successful what I'm saying by this do you have the most beautiful elegant sexy logo of all time and if your content doesn't is not relevant to them they're not going to give a the truth is is that branding and logos and beautiful website design is kind of overrated as it comes to blogging what more matters of blogging is the message that you're sharing and how well you're sharing it so especially if you're a beginner guys especially if you're starting out your logo and your design and overthinking all of this process is not a smart way to start think about it later on once you've designed amazing products once you've turned tons of your readers into customers only then think about okay let's look at my branding let's look at my design let's try to get a font so guys that's my conclusion on the subject this is not something you need to be concerned with until much much further down the road I hope you liked this short video
