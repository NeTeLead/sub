 all right so I'm gonna talk a little bit about nostalgia as an ist ga I think I I think I talked about something similar before in another video I can't remember but I have a weird relationship with nostalgia that's sort of a stereotype that is TJ's are you know we're naturally or SI Dom's in general are naturally I guess inclined to be nostalgic same with probably INF peas as well but uh I have a strange relationship with nostalgia one thing I noticed with me as I am sort of aware of my quasi inclination towards nostalgia and I avoid it like the plague so one example would be I might have a lot of old photos on my on my phone and let's say I run out of space I mean if you're really nostalgic you'd probably want to upload those photos to something and save them but for me I intentionally delete old photos I get rid of them and I long times I don't hold on to old stuff I mean sometimes I do but I mean if I can I like to force myself to get rid of old stuff because I don't want to feel the I guess emotional pain of having to come to terms with something that's past me or something that's gone by and I won't get back so for that reason you know even though I might have pleasant memories about things there's some things that I don't always like to think about because if I really enjoyed a certain period in my life I don't want to be constantly reminded that that's over and I'm not getting that back a lot of people like to like you know play an old song that reminds them of when they were like a teenager or something and reminisce about those times but to me that sort of thing just makes me sad more than anything if I'm listening to an old song it's probably because not for the nostalgia it's probably cuz I actually like that song outside of whatever memories are associated with it so I tend to kind of avoid those cuz I honestly I'm afraid of more negative emotions I like to keep things positive I don't I don't particularly feel comfortable with negative emotions I don't really know how to handle them now the reason I bring this up is because I had somebody who's familiar or I guess pretty knowledgeable on over in the Dave super powers objective personality sect of the typology community now I know a lot of you probably aren't Dave super powers fans or some of you are some of you probably don't like them some of you probably think his systems wack I'm just offering another perspective so I had someone telling me that uh or at least they personally do type me still as an ISTJ both in their system and of course in whatever system I use but I mean I'm I would say I use more of a socionics sort of angle on things but apparently an individual from the objective personality community they also taught me as nice to Jay but what they said is they have what's known as like an animal stack and so they had me they had me blast play consume sleep now what it means having sleep last in that stack is that because of my function stack and the way everything is I would actually I would actually have a better relationship with my extraverted intuition that my introverted feeling because when you have play and consume yeah when you have play and consume before sleep it means you're going to be using your extroverted functions or at least that that third of that fourth expert intuition you're gonna be using that more than you would your FI because in order to touch that that last introverted function you'd need to have sleep higher up so basically even though at least in their system even though Annie's my force loss function my my most difficult relationship would have to be with introverted feeling at least according to objective personality I know a lot of you were just gonna disagree with them and say that that's not their systems wack but just another perspective so according to them my or this one individual I shouldn't say them cuz I don't know if everyone enough Opie would type me the same but according to this person MA I yeah sleep is lost so my weirdest relationship is gonna be with my introverted feeling it's gonna be the last thing I do the last thing I'm do is gonna be getting in touch with my emotions it's what I don't do enough of basically it's what I need to learn to do more of spending time analyzing my feelings so basically it's yeah so I would explain why I have a weird relationship with nostalgia and I'm not comfortable with negative emotions I'm not basically in a nutshell I'm not very comfortable with my own feelings and I don't spend enough time sort of reflecting on them and really getting down to how I feel about things it sort of swept under the rug I need to basically learn to spend more time engaging with how I really feel independent of any other forces just how do I feel what do I actually want and according to them my si my introverted sensing and my exterior thing would be masculine functions for me I'd be double masculine ISTJ but that would mean my bottom two functions fi and Annie would be feminine soul mate feminine fi combined with also being one of my demon functions and combined with being sleep last would mean I'm kind of wishy-washy and how I feel and I also don't engage with it very much so fi is supposed to be like a trouble area for me at least an objective personality compared to most I guess usual is DJs but yeah that would explain why I have you know a peculiar relationship with nostalgia despite being an IAS DJ and a peculiar relationship with my emotions in general well it's all I got more of an objective personality perspective I know a lot of you probably aren't down with their stuff or might disagree but whatever just another thing to consider thank you very much for watching I hope you leave a like and please subscribe as well have a great day
