 hello look at these cookie cutter suburban households that looks so pretty good fantastic evening all right let's film this video all right okay okay so I shaved my head I think it looks a lot better to be honest I was really postponing that my hair line was like well I mean you can see where my hair line is and I had like a little bit of hair kind of like did I do this with and then you turn my head to be all thin up here looks like I'm not trying to hide anything anyways so I'm about to go to the gym but I just wanted to drop some insight on you guys I've had this concept on my mind for quite a while and I'm really passionate about it right now so hopefully I can take this philosophy going forward and that is the idea that self-improvement is not everything I used to spend so much time reading self-improvement books subscribing to self-improvement YouTube channels self-improvement subreddits and it was stressful to be honest with you I was not fulfilled I started to ask myself how come I can spend so much time on self-improvement books and subreddits and videos yet still not be totally satisfied like how come I don't have much of a social life how come I'm not doing perfectly in school etc etc I had to go through this I'm like what gives I'm pouring so much time into self-improvement yet nothing is really changing I'm not really like much better off then I started to realize that I'm not really doing anything like what I'm reading self-improvement books like like what am i doing real like what is that accomplishing all these self-improvement books talk about how to do things better but if all you're doing is reading the book instead of actually like reading it and then applying it by doing things you're not better off at all I'd read are slash productivity all these productivity tips would be up there how to organize your Google Drive how to you know make sure you're productive early in the morning and I would I'd read and read and read but I wasn't really doing anything I did not take that advice and then apply it to real life self-improvement and productivity was my hobby I wasn't actually like improving the actual things in my life and living those things and I wasn't actually being productive in those things I was just obsessing over being productive and obsessing over self-improvement instead of just living so the point I'm trying to get at is if self-improvement is your main hobby honestly get a better hobby don't ditch self-improvement altogether because you should always be reading new insights as to how to live your life better more effectively etc but do other things man here's a good example okay so these are the kinds of books that I'd buy when I was addicted to self-improvement the 4-hour chef creativity deep work Thinking Fast and Slow why am i why am i showing you the sides of the book the richest man in Babylon the obstacle is the way the checklist manifesto subtle art of not giving a 12 rules for life by Jordan Peterson great book think like a freak how to win friends and influence people you are a badass I started reading it and I could not get past the introduction all those books are like self-improvement books productivity books business books start up books instructional how-to books and a lot of the time I didn't even finish reading them I just buy them because the act of buying them gave me like a dopamine rush and made me feel like oh I if I buy this book my life's gonna stop sucking but in reality my life sucked because I wasn't taking care of those pillars that's not a good I wasn't actually learning how to enjoy going the gym for the sake of corn in the gym I wasn't learning how to cook so that I could eat better and enjoy good food I was in expanding my friends circle and becoming better at conversations and just enjoying the act of spending time with people all I was doing was reading about how to do all those things better you don't win at this by reading this you can read this to help you with these but these are what it's all about the way of kings by Brandon Sanderson totally fictional medieval fantasy 1200 pages actually yeah it's like 1200 pages long of nothing but made-up shit and I am enjoying the hell out of it this is helping me just enjoy the present moment so anyways I'm gonna start making videos still about self-improvement for sure because it's like this is a self-improvement channel but make sure to use the advice I give you on your actual life make sure to hang out with friends go to the gym eat good food we good literature listen to good music expand your mind work hard not too hard be smart be charming and enjoy life if you liked this video hit that like button if you disagree with everything I said make sure to comment it instead of just hitting that dislike button because that's just not really helpful I'm starting a Facebook group in which you can post your own productivity advice you can listen to my productivity advice we can help each other out like each other's posts the link is in the description it's a no-brainer to join that if you have facebook join that right now become one of the first
