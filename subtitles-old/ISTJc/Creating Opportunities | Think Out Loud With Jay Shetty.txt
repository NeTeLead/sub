 my name is Jay Shetty I'm an on-line presents a host and producer and former monk today I'm here in this beautiful library talking about creating opportunity I'm really excited to talk to you about this and I really wanted to start off by talking about this quote that we all hear like the press the like button if you heard this quote before we've all heard the quote good things come to those who wait maybe your father said it to you maybe your mother said it to you maybe your uncle or auntie or your friend or maybe your teacher send it to you write good things come to those who wait I want you to tell me what you think of that quote has that principle worked for you has that in life made any difference right I want to hear your views so in the comments section just type away let me know what you're thinking let me know what you think about advice that piece of advice that good things come to those who wait because today we're doing about creating opportunities so actually I want to change that my opinion on that quote is that we need to change that from good things come to those who wait to good things come to those who create the people that actually create their own opportunities the people that take responsibility and ownership to make a difference in their life and the lives of other people and as we've been building this global conscious community I know so many of you have stimulating ideas about how you're going to bring about change we often think that creative opportunity means it has to be rushed or hurried or it means you have to have lots of stuff going on and sometimes that can get quite draining it can get quite overwhelming it can start to feel as if we don't know how we're going to move forward but what I notice now is that we need to balance that theory with the value of creating opportunities there's a great quote by a Roman philosopher named Seneca where he said that luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity right that's what happens when preparation meets opportunity something that we don't really have a lot of talked about today and I was thinking about I used to have an economics teacher and this economics teacher I remember the first day you walked into school he walked into school I still I believe we had whiteboards by that time I'm not out he had whiteboard and on the whiteboard he wrote down he goes failing to prepare is preparing to fail and I remember all of us is bursting out laughing and we just thought oh my god is he a philosopher or an economics teacher right here oh but failing to prepare is preparing to fail he wrote that down on the board and I'm thinking to myself I'm going oh my god another one of these philosophers because I wasn't even into philosophy myself and when he broke that down now I'm gonna look back and I think wow that was such a powerful statement that was so true so Seneca Roman philosopher says the same thing he says luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity so one of the things I wanted to talked about how do we create opportunity in our life when we're trying to develop patience within ourselves you'll find that when you're working to your purpose when you're working in a connected way when you're working in the direction where you feel focus you naturally develop patience we often feel we don't have patience when things aren't working out and things usually don't work out when we're not working in a way that works for us one of the things that I wanted to speak to you about talking about that is the ability to really understand times at which when we need to make things almost difficult again now I don't need to invite difficulties into your life that's not what I'm recommending but hear me out for a second what I'm trying to say is that often you have to go back to feeling feeling like you have nothing so that you can create something again a great example of this was actually ela musk and I don't know how many of you've read his autobiography it's absolutely phenomenal story biography and he talked about that when he sold PayPal his earnings were 180 million now he split that straight away I think in a matter of about three months he put a hundred million into SpaceX he put 70 million into Tesla and he put 10 million into Solar City if you add that all up if you're cricket maps and you've probably done it already that's 180 million already gone right he said that he was struggling to pay rent he had to borrow money to pay rent the guy's a millionaire why did he do that he says that he had to feel that desperation again that ability to want to make a change yet we live that you can create opportunity in your life if you're someone who thinks maybe it's your business maybe it's in your relationships maybe it's at work wherever it is whether you're an entrepreneur you try to grow your career wherever you are we all need to create opportunities how can we do that but how do we all take that leap of faith so you're somewhere you're okay with where you're at you're probably saying okay you're with where you're right you're comfortable with it but you know that there's more out there for you how do you take that leap of faith one of the ways that I believe we take that leap of faith is actually launch something new then talk about it rather than the other way around often what we do is we spend a lot of our time talking about doing something and we never get around to actually making it happen but actually what I recommend is just start doing something small I love talking about Facebook when Facebook first launched it was only meant to be for Harvard right Mark Zuckerberg Amedda it works for Harvard it then branched out to the Ivy League universities in the States it then branched out over to Cambridge and Oxford and the top universities and institutions in England and then I believe across the world but notice that it's a testing period and you see loads of tech firms do this brilliantly today they're experts at starting small and scaling up so the my main recommendation is start small do not try and start big and really think about how you can launch something and then talk about it don't start talking about something first usually when you throw out an idea if you get criticism for it straight away you're less likely to see it through how many of you have ever seen a article and a new app a new book a new idea and you've got oh my god I had the idea like two years ago how many of you ever felt that way right I've been in that camp right my hands right up put your virtual hands up if that's one of you it happens to all of us all the time you see a new launch of a restaurant you see a new launch of a product and you say but I had that idea I came up with that the funny thing is if you came up with that idea two years ago it means someone started working on it for years ago notice it's the people who start acting quicker they're the ones you grow quicker so kids don't do what you say they do is you do the way we behave so if children see has been impatient all the time they're naturally going to be impatient I'm not saying any of you are impatient but it it's definitely possible that it works that way I was talking with the monk about three years ago and I was having this conversation in this dialogue about being extremely ambitious wanting to make lots of things happen and I said how do you know where to put your energy and he gave me a phenomenal response and his response was that you should keep all your doors open and he said in life naturally doors will start to closed walk through the ones that stay open our biggest challenge in life is often we don't create enough options and opportunities we feel like there's one path I remember at one point and I really recommend doing this I made a list of everyone I admired in life right I made a list of names I then went on Wikipedia I know it's not the best place but that's the place I started I've researched every single person's life story I research their journey I research how they got to where they were the amazing thing there's no formula the formula is that there's completely complete inconsistency it's not that there was just one route so recognize realize and embrace the fact that there's multiple routes to the same place you want to be so one of our biggest challenges is feeling that there's only one way there's only one opportunity there's only one part but that's actually there couldn't be anything more untrue and so I've been going along with this theme of break-up with the one breakup with the idea that there's only one path to where you want to be right breakup with the idea that there's only one thing it's definitely not the way there can be multiple paths to where you want to be so how do you know which opportunities to choose between start with three start with five start with seven notice the ones that are losing momentum and start putting effort into the ones that are gaining momentum start with your talents one of the things that we make a mistake on all the time is we don't start with our talents use your talents more find opportunities that allow you to be yourself and express yourself more when you start engaging your natural talents things will start to happen people who create opportunities are able to see opportunities everywhere not see problems or criticism so our mind has this natural tendency where we sometimes when we see things we can see what's wrong with it if you want to be someone who creates opportunities in if instead of looking at something and seeing what's wrong with it start thinking about how you'd solve that problem in everything in life if you're walking around I sometimes do this and I see massive billboards and I think well if I was selling that product I'd I think about it like this I'd rename or retitle or rebrand it to look in this way and then sometimes I'll look at something else I'll look at an app or a look at a new piece of technology or software now look at that I'll go wait a minute that you know that doesn't quite fit but it's easy anyone can spot something that's wrong right we all know that it doesn't take a genius to support a problem in the subway system or in a meal or a restaurant that it isn't a genius but what we need to do is start creating opportunity by training our mind to actually do that habitually so try and create that habit for yourself where anything you see don't try and think of what's wrong about it think of how you would solve it now I'm not going I'm not expecting you to go out there and learn lots of new skills and start fixing everything you see that's broken but it's just training our mind getting our mind into that habit that evolution of approaching challenges in that way but I find that we have this desire or this search where we're always trying to say do we do this all that actually we need to embrace polarities we need to embrace both we need to try and figure out and try what works for you so I would say start with both and see which is working for you keep that habit up test it experiment with it right don't don't ever lose the experiment of life that could work for you first thing to understand is that the only thing that's consistent is change so unpredictability is actually the norm that we expose ourselves to on a day-to-day basis we all know that right there's no guarantee of how the day is going to go there's no guarantee of how things are going to work that creates tons of anxiety right we always want to know what's happening at what time so that creates tons of anxiety so the only way to monitor that is first of all just accept that things aren't always going to work work the way we want them to work the second thing in terms of patience is start working and giving your energies to the things that are moving the things that do have momentum the things that are working they are there we've just stopped noticing therefore one of the biggest ways to become a person who creates opportunities on a daily basis is the ability to notice and observe notice the people that are helping you right there's a great story I like to tell about a gentleman who's whose name is free from my mind at the moment but I'm sure we got our Charles plan that is his name's Charles plants and Charles plum he used to be a fighter pilot during the time of the war now when he was a fighter pilot every day people would pack his parachute people would pack his lunch people would arm their air people check that the aeroplane was fine people checked that the fighter jet had ammunition he'd have so many people around him he was one of the best fighter pilots many many years on in recent times he would have at a restaurant with his wife and this gentleman came up to him and said hold your Charles Palmer you've recognized him you know when you recognize someone even when you haven't seen them in a long time so Charles Brunn recognized him and he said so if this gentleman recognized Charles plumb and he said you're Charles plumb in Charlton yeah yes I am and and he said oh I remember you and transform said oh I I don't remember you and you know when you do that thing when you start scanning through faces in your mind trying to recall this person that you don't recognize at all and say Stiles prompt starts scanning faces and his mind and he couldn't recall it or put something you know it's kind of like you wish you had what Google glass was meant to be or you kind of wish you had what the Terminator has where you can just scan people's names and details and it all appears so he couldn't do that and he said sorry I don't recognize you I'm really sorry in a genuine way said I don't recognize you and the man said I used to pack your parachute he said I used to pack your parachute and Charles promised that he said Wow so he started to think of every person and he said do you know what I can't remember anyone who packed my parachute that night he went home and he was thinking about this how he couldn't remember the person who packed his parachute the amazing thing was he then remembered that on his last flight he was saved because he jumped out of his air is his aircraft that was that was exploding he jumped out and he was saved by the parachute and he thought for a second he thought wow basically I don't even know the person who saved my life and he went back and now he's talking more across the world and he's talking about this remember the person who packs your parachute right one of our biggest challenges to your question going back to your question is what should we do in the context of patience you know when things are out of control focus on the things where people are investing in you where I focus on the people that are making a difference in your life we are so oblivious to the fact that there are countless people who are investing in your growth opportunity to come to you and you're not ready I remember a piece of advice from Richard Branson now he didn't give it to me personally even though I like to think that he did I may hear his voice in my head when I think it through but he said this brilliant statement he said that when you get an opportunity you think you're not ready for say yes and then figure out how to do it and I remember reading that when I was 18 years old and I thought wow that's genius I'm gonna try that out I'm gonna experiment with that statement now that a statements got me into a lot of trouble sometimes but most of the time it's worked why because when I said yes to an opportunity I didn't feel I was ready for I then had the incentive and the catalyst to go out there and study learn build grow whereas when I waited to be ready for an opportunity I never had the push to grow hence going back to that place we sometimes need to go back to feeling like we have nothing to then feel like we have an energy to go and achieve something again you've got to put yourself in that mindset so actually what I'd say to that is don't ever feel that you're not ready even if you are say you are and then go and learn how to do it don't let the opportunity pass now in the case that you've already let it pass don't worry just change your attack next time that's it's as simple as that so I did a session a couple of weeks ago which is all about thriving in our element see it's always important to find your nature in work so if you're in a work space find what you're going to thriver and work towards it so sometimes you're going to be in an environment or in a in a job or in a career whatever it is that doesn't fit your natural skill set that isn't the natural space field so go and find the things in that environment that fit for you it's kind of like kind of like I'm gonna give you my example so I just moved to New York yesterday I was going out for lunch I had to find someone that I knew knew the area well right my friend Stephanie at work I had to ask her and she knew a great place we could go and eat now the best way to do that was I had to find something that I liked by sharing with someone what I liked eating why don't we apply that to life by sharing what we like doing with people close to us by sharing what our expertise and talents are that person or that environment can then help us live that in that way so sometimes sometimes you have to do a bit of moulding to your environment and sometimes your environment will mold itself towards you the point is not either/or the point is try both out but the key thing there is always always always work to your strengths go all-in think about what is it that you can totally commit to now it won't be easy to do and that may not turn up tomorrow so go with the closest thing at the time I guarantee you you learn a lot more from it I just shared something on Twitter just because I'm before I came inside and I believe it's a famous startup quote I can remember who by but the principle is that if you're waiting for your app or product to be perfect you've already waited too long right it's that feeling that if you're waiting for something to be perfect your perfection is getting it right it's it's already too late to launch so the idea is is that everything we do we want to do with a certain level of finesse we want to do with a certain level of expertise with a certain level of focus and it's focus that should be our aim not perfection when perfection becomes our aim it almost constricts us and acts like a prison that surround us and actually limits us from acting because perfection is so hard so instead of your aim being perfection make your aim focus make your aim exclusive devotion dedication and focus on the art as opposed to perfection of the result the result is always beyond us but the perfection of the art or the focus of the art is something you can aim for so I really recommend going on a time management course it's that simple we have to invest if you want to change your ability to manage time it's something that needs to be invested in so one of my key tips it's a very simple framework it's the old school an important framework it's really important to recognize in your life what's urgent what's important what's both and what's not so just creating a matrix just being able to divide things according to that will allow you to plan your day better I always recommend that you tan plan your day the night before you plan your week at the beginning of the week on a Sunday write the beginning of the week is Sunday not Monday I know some calendars get that right some calendars get that wrong but if you want to have a successful week you need to be planning it the day before the week start a lot of people we don't worry about the first step and funnily enough the first step has to be a bit of a step in the dark it's kind of like you've got to get your feet wet you've got to be open to not getting it right it's unfortunate that's just the way it is and that's why I'd say the quicker you can do that one of the best ways is to do it with someone right when you can take someone along with you and they're gonna make a fool out of themselves too or it's not gonna go quite as planned but you can share that experience with someone that's one of the quickest ways as to make that first step towards a new opportunity do it with someone that you trust experience that with someone together right that's one of the best ways of doing it but I'll really encourage you to start becoming what I like to call connected thinkers I would spend if you can one day a week and if you can't do one day a week one hour a week just speaking to people right just engaging with people that you think inspire you people that you think doing something interesting even tuning in here right it's just giving yourself something daily something weekly that allows you to open up your mind to things that you wouldn't usually hear about so the ability to network the ability to open your brain is definitely something that I recommend how many of you have a challenge saying yes I'm sure some of you saw a movie a few years ago called the yes man and if you've ever tried that it can be a lot of fun but it can also be quite overwhelming and overbearing so it's the balance of knowing what - say yes - what - no - what I usually recommend is start by saying yes do a lot of stuff then start sifting out the stuff that you don't want to focus on it almost starts we all go through that journey if you look at the journey of anyone who's created opportunities they'll tell you at the start they just said yesterday everything and then as time went on they realized they were overwhelm they went through that process that we all go through of saying oh god I've said yes there's too many things and then you start taking out the stuff weeding out the stuff that doesn't warrant the investment that doesn't really justify the amount of time you are giving into that item is we're only seeing one root when we're having tunnel vision when we're feeling that there's only one location there's only one method there's only one direction that's usually what creates that frustration and annoyance whereas when we look at something that okay and I'll give you an example so I have a young nephew I hope he's watching he's super cute one of those cute kids I've ever seen if I then say so myself but the great thing about him is now when he learned to crawl at first he'd love to crawl to you and crawl on top of you and and you know walk around with you et cetera but then after a while when he what he started to do is if you stood in his way and he got more confident he'd find another way around you he'd walk around you he'd walk all over you he'd walk under you he'd he'd just be trying to find another way to get to the part of the room he wasn't allowed to go to and I thought wow like as a child as children all of us have been now right it's not like that's a kid and it's alien we've all been there and that kid has that ability that child has that ability to completely feel like there's no nothing impossible there's no possibility there's limitless opportunity and possibility to get to the place where they want to get to it's as we grow older we kind of narrow ourselves down into this tunnel vision of believing there's only one way so that annoyance of frustration comes when we don't look at other alternatives when we don't look at other options right how many of us feel like that that our potential our talents are not being tapped into you know what the funniest thing is is that we can wait a long time to find the people that will tap into our potential or we can create opportunities for demonstrating that potential and I noticed that the people that succeed the people that flourished the people that thrived there the individuals who actually create those opportunities where they can demonstrate their potential often our potential is just hidden away and people are so busy trying to excavate their own potential and create their own opportunities they don't have time for us so yes it would be beautiful if all leaders in the world and I definitely want to talk to I'm gonna be bringing some leadership experts in to actually have this interview conversation with them I'm quite interested in how we can create a bleed of leaders who are expert of finding talent quicker better faster more effectively but until that happens until we create that which I'd love to be a part of until we do that it's significant that we don't wait for people to tap into our potential we tap into ourselves and demonstrate so I can only recommend to you Divya that actually don't wait for that to happen right go out there find opportunities to demonstrate that how do you know what is your calling in a place of so much opportunity again I bring it back to a principle I like to talk about called exper man like a scientist right it's scientists don't know what the right answer is it's not like the first time they do a test that it reacts in the right way it's not the first time that they do an experiment they get the solution they want but you experiment like a scientist you experiment with the calling that seems closest if that doesn't work you learn from it then experiment with the next one right it's never limiting the amount of experiments in terms of prioritizing your tasks I mean you probably have stuff that's assignments objectives results led I would say that you should be spending I've also one thing it's natural at work to spend 75% or 80% of your time investing in what your actual work is what I recommend is that you take out 25% of your time a week 20% a week 10% a week to focus on personal projects focus on personal ideas I love this I was at Google offices in London some time ago and they showed me they took me up to this roof and on the top of the Google roof it was just covered in plots of people planting stuff and and it was just full of people planting seeds and flowers and plants and vegetables and all this kind of different things now I I was amused because I was just like why is this on top of a random Garden in London especially when the weather's terrible all the time like what's the point of this and so the senior manager that I was with he explained that the reason why have this is so that people can come up here take pine the process of planting see it's bright you know gardening taking pine that process and that they would connect with people that they didn't work with so everyone segments everyone's piece of land would be different to the area which they worked in inside the company so they were able to network break down boundaries create a borderless world a borderless organization where people from different areas from sales to media to tech to developers to video to presenters whatever it was what would find a space that they could connect so we need to find 20-25 percent of our life that opportunity to give us that time opportunity isn't selfish right opportunity isn't about you it's about a win-win situation and this change in mindset totally radicalized my view of what creating opportunities meant growing up I always for creative opportunities meant getting something for myself and meant personal gain it meant personal growth and I often never thought about the other person I often never thought about how my behavior my activities my network could potentially benefit another individual and I learned that by watching people in this space people who always think win-win people who think a givers mindset they don't go to someone expecting some they go to someone thinking they can give and offer something and when that person recognizes that that's a value to them they're more naturally inclined to want to support and and this is something that we missed today we missed today in society in a world where we constantly think of ourselves we do much self-development but selfless development is as important in our own journey as is self-development so I would definitely point out that factor that think about your skills think about your talents think about your networks think about people that you know and think about how the people you want to work with the people you want to connect with could actually benefit because I guarantee you when you do that the switch in their mind will also go to that factor of oh how can i benefit as well right how can I make a benefit or an impact in that person's life so please please start thinking win-win when you think of opportunities for others it will simply create more opportunities for you I tell so many stories in some of the videos that I produced which I know many of you have watch we are constantly facing rejections I talk about JK Rowling twelve rejections from 12 publishers you look at Sylvester Stallone the rocky saga which is now at number six movie number six with Creed right it's like you look at that he was rejected by 99 producers for his concept of rocky now some of you may agree and so that was a good idea unless a rocky fan so I disagree but the point is is 99 rejections there are multiple rejections constantly for anyone who has succeeded you talk about Michael Jordan right in the game of basketball you look at the amount of failures he talks well I think he's missed like 2,000 shots and we match winning shot so he was meant to take and you think what how did he do that like really I've only seen or any scores and that's the funny thing that we only talk about failures after people succeed and therefore what happens is that failing becomes a taboo and we don't talk about it in society as much as we could we we don't talk about it when we fail we don't tell our friend we only tell a friend when we succeed so I'm not saying that now you go on Facebook and Twitter and snapchat and start sharing all your failures but what I am saying is recognizing that failure has been an integral part in the journey and success of any individual anyone right whether they're externally successful today whether you've seen them succeed whether you haven't I guarantee you when you study their life you'll see countless failures in their journey so please go and study and that's why we have to observe and study the lives of successful people in order to follow in those footsteps so definitely take a look at that we all have bosses that don't like us we all go through that process where we have managers people leading us that stress us out the amazing thing is that doing what you love is actually reducing stress so if you love your job which you said here Juliana you love your job you enjoy it believe me if that wasn't the case that level of stress would be heightened and that level of stress would be much harder to deal with so to change around what you're doing that you already enjoy and you love to remove the specimen of another person it's probably not the right direction to go and I wouldn't recommend that but what I would recommend is either changing spaces of work changing which area of the business you're functioning in or if young done is already having a frank conversation with that individual creating a broader council broader structure of managers around you who do understand you right we've all been in that situation where were challenged by individuals the challenge that faces us all when we get to a space of comfort and contentment is that we have to go back to feeling like we have nothing I'm not saying we have to go back to being like we have nothing we've got to go back to feeling like we have nothing I was the reason why I did this conversation today I was thinking about it when I left the office yesterday when I left the studio I was thinking about this I was thinking we've got to constantly remind ourselves of what hustle it took to get to where we are what work it took to get to where we are what sacrifice it took to get to where you are and often they say that what got you here won't get you there but again I I don't totally agree with that I think that's partly true but the other side is that actually what got you here is going to help you go further that philosophy work for you we all have a philosophy of life we all have a karma of life that works for us and if we ignore that and go against it it's likely that that won't happen I think I was saying in a session that I did on decisions I was saying that some of the best decisions in my life have been massive risks against the grain and everyone thought it was a bad idea right and so I've stuck to that that karma works for me so it's about identifying the first thing is identification often we leave a bad situation for something that's only slightly better because it solves us solves our experience in the temporary phase and that only leads to more issues so it's better for us to sit down take some time out try out the 16 personalities calm tests on identifying your strengths identifying what works for you start with that step one second thing is start building that on top of what you're already doing if it's a new skill start focusing on being in those spaces where those people employ where those people are are pleasant where you can connect with people I would really start by talking to people who already do the jobs you think you love and I go back to think you love because often when you do that job or you speak to people who are doing and they explain their experience or express their experience then actually we really open and tell you this is what it's like in you bla oh wow that that's not how I imagined it at all I didn't see that that's what I'd be doing day to day so second thing I recommend is after finding out your strengths speak to people in those roles that you think may be right for you and figure out if they actually are third thing is network being those spaces talk to people try and get yourself in as you have done before an amazing thing today is that the online world there's meetups there's live face-to-face if you feel you're better in person there's Meetup you can find them online visit them in person right there's so many like coffee houses right old platform new way of doing them and if you prefer actually being connected with people online but we've got all of these online networks it's so important that all of us learn the value of connecting with individuals online and today everything's human-to-human whether it's b2b whether it be to see people want to connect with people so expressing what you're doing right share what you know share what you do and do what you share it's so important when you share what you do you connect with people that want to do that too and do what you share actually genuinely live up to it actually make it happen I want to go back and remind us that the Roman philosopher Seneca said luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity I remember one thing that I'm gonna leave you with one thing I used to do Isis a to myself if I was in this ideal situation that I really want how would I behave I would plan my behavior before I'd even been given the opportunity then when the opportunity came you nailed it right so I hope you'll be able to do that give a like on my facebook page at jay Shetty IW where i share lots of motivation and stuff daily give a like to the Huff Post rise Facebook page take care and keep talking keep typing and keep speaking to each other thanks so much take care guys
