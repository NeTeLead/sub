 hello everybody it's Michael Pearce here happy Columbus Day am I the only one celebrating it maybe I don't know right I I think Columbus is fascinating and I want to try to type him and there are several reasons for this one is because I kind of want to demonstrate at least my I don't have really a method of typing I mainly go off of intuition and I will simply present what I've seen of the data and sort of my reasons and leave it in the understanding that I could be completely wrong but also one of the things that I think is useful to do is I want to be very clear about where I am drawing my information from so that people will know where to look and will also know what I have not I'm not factoring in and where to look to maybe find contradictory evidence one of the problems with typing is you're kind of I guess maybe not entirely there are some ways maybe to introduce some more falsifiability into the process but often it kind of amounts to piling up a lot of excuse me positive evidence like that they are this type or evidence that they are not this particular type but you are still just kind of stockpiling evidence you're not doing the more scientific process and that's not really possible with this sort of thing and that's not just a matter of typing that's a matter of really anything and the softer Sciences are in humanities I shouldn't say softer Sciences they'd get angry with me for that but so I I guess I just sort of wanted to demonstrate at least me trying to to type someone but probably more I wanted to just talk about Columbus so the book I have here this is Christopher Columbus the four voyages it is edited and translated by JM Cowan excuse me and it is a well I'll read the little thing here being his own logbook letters and dispatches with connecting narrative drawn from the life of the admirer well excuse me the life of the admirer 'l by his son Hernando colon and other contemporary historians historians of Columbus's time so it's literally just like an anthology that kind of runs through the the four voyages piecing together these different narratives because it's not like Columbus kept a you didn't well he did but we don't have all the journals and it's a little confusing I'll get into a little bit of that as I get into the video but um Columbus obviously has been he's been made far posthumously the subject I guess he's really kind of just been made into a symbol that can be you know hated on desecrated and I think people are really missing out because we have a very interesting multifaceted figure I I just I don't like the it just seems very cheap and easy to me when people you know call them a con man or you know are like because there's always this assumption that well you learned in school like I did that Columbus was this remarkable saintly figure that descended from on high and well this is the real story man because I'm an edge lord and it's like I never learned that in school so that's never resident I didn't learn really anything about Columbus in school that I can remember we just didn't even really talk about him so I never got that that kind of starry-eyed vision I guess other people did and they sort of have have projected their own vision of the tyrannical father on to Columbus they've made Columbus their symbol I'm not going to get in a whole III haven't I haven't thought nearly enough about what other people have said about Columbus I'm not gonna get into that I am just going to simply present to you what people in his own time and he himself wrote and you can decide what what what you want about him to to start right off I'm just gonna say that where I am leaning for his type is I definitely think I am I am I'm not gonna say I'm certain but I am definitely highly inclined to think from from at least what I've read here and I'm not going through the whole book here I'm mainly going to focus on the first voyage because I have limited time at the moment but in the future I might go through the the other voyages shoot what was I talking about oh yes I believe that he is an S II and I type specifically I think he is an S II dominant type I believe he has very a strong inferior and I that was a little bit out of control sometimes which can can be the case for a dominant se types and as for the middle access is judgment access I lean towards TEF I I think he was an es FP but possibly an est P but we'll get into why I lean more towards es FP I kind of have come to read him as a very boisterous energetic occasionally irresponsible but a very very driven person so actually let's first and start with them one of the things by the way about this is that JM Cullen is not really a fan of Columbus he is trying to be a very unbiased scholar but in his introduction he makes it pretty clear that he is you know perfectly happy being very critical of Columbus and actually I think that some of the statements he makes in the introduction are not supported by the documents he includes in the book but I don't know I could be reading that wrong so let's go into a couple of things I don't know how much I'll quote from here I'll probably like so let me read this portion because this is a good place to start Columbus felt himself to be guided by a supernatural destiny to make the discoveries that he did and to add greatly to the dominions of the Catholic sovereigns as Christopher he was fated to carry his redeemer on his shoulders into distant lands it is this supernatural sense of mission to be read in all his writings that impelled him to the Indies and caused him to continue his search whether for the mainland of Asia or the earthly paradise almost to the end of his life his gains and Happiness were small and wealth not enormous but in patents of nobility which he valued highly very great excuse me yeah he did not ultimately make himself very wealthy for various reasons but um what I want to focus on obviously is that's a very and I kind of thing right is and technically n is e is and you you see it even just by the fact that he was willing to do this because literally it's it's made clear by some of the documents here that the reason that Columbus was so because he was like famous in his own time when he got back from the first voyage there were like parades and things like people were so because he brought back all this evidence that yeah I actually went to this place he brought Indians back with him not in Chains they it's it's complicated with the with being able to translate with them oh I'll get into that in a minute but there's like parades that he found they assumed yeah he found Asia later pretty quickly on people started to question him on that which he didn't like because he had this overriding sense of this is what I'm going to do this is my destiny this is the future for me there's like one point when you know what might be if I just run through very briefly a summary of kind of what happened with the first voyage so you get an idea of what the framework is here so you have Christopher Columbus unclear exactly where he came from there's some indication apparently that he had done some practical sailing work and merchant work before he had a son excuse me he was Italian Corsican that area in the Mediterranean and then for some reason it's it's never said or showed in this volume so I'd be curious if somebody has like earlier journals I would have thought that JM cone would include that but it's possible we just don't have it but at some point he got the idea and it really I think would have had to have been almost like a kind of vision or something not like literally a vision but like an an eye vision that took ahold of him and he just decided I need to cross the ocean and get to the Indies I think I can do that he just got this idea I think what it was is it's mentioned in the introduction and Columbus himself in one of his because what we have here is Columbus on the first voyage he kept to this very faithful diary or we should say he forced himself to sit down and record in a logbook every day we do not have the original logbook but we do have in some sense what could be better to some degree it's it's a man named las Casas who was someone very sympathetic to the Indians by the way he wrote a whole other book in defense of the Indians that got him in a lot of trouble but he was like one of these early people who detailed all of these horrible things that happen to the Indians and why we should not be doing that but a las Casas got ahold of and he was I think contemporary or maybe one generation after Columbus got ahold of Columbus's journals his log books from the first voyage and he made a digest of it he copied it down not the not word-for-word though there are large portions where it's just quotations from Columbus and so we have his digest of Columbus's log book excuse me and so some of the quotations of Columbus that we have in there near the beginning in fact he mentions Marco Polo who was you know kind of a superstar at the time and he mentions he had sort of this idea that he was gonna cross the Atlantic Ocean because he's like well the world is round like I learned that because you know educated people of time and and and the thing was this is why I think he was more of a Nessie and I type because he's like my goal is to get to Asia because I want to be the next Marco Polo kind of like he had that kind of innocence but I'm gonna like actually succeed in converting these people to Christianity and this will be great we'll be able to trade with them directly and also will convert them all to Christianity so we can catch the he at one point he doesn't explicitly say this but it's sort of heavily implied that part of the strategy here that sort of sold him to the the Spanish king and queen was that if they could convert one coast of Asia to Christianity then they would catch Islam which Spain was warring with at the time between two fronts you see so we'd have Christian Huns on the one side and Christian Spanish people and Europeans on the other side tada and we can we can then convert Islam so that's kind of interesting that seems to have been an idea that they had obviously that did not work out because America was in the way. Columbus he it's emphasized in the introduction I think a little bit more harshly than is called for that like Columbus did not calculate the mileage like correctly at all he like was way like as he says here Columbus's theories were even more rigid and more optimistic than Tosca Nellie's tuscan le was I believe the contemporary are a little bit earlier than him but he was one of these scientists who you know everybody knew the world was round anybody educated knew the world was round they had even calculated things very well but Columbus's theories he mentally fixed the distance between Portugal and Japan at two thousand seven hundred and sixty miles the actual distance is twelve thousand miles week and we can well and then he says we can no more exact except Hernando Cullen's claim that his father was a man of education then that he was of noble descent which mr. Cohen I think you're you're going a little bit too far there because educated people just be even though you're educated doesn't mean that you necessarily have learned anything but anyway that's a that's a side issue the point is and this presumably is at least one of the reasons why I'm jumping around so much here and I apologize for that but maybe it'll give you a mosaic picture of Columbus here he was rejected four times by different you know sovereigns who he went to with this idea that it's like we if we can get across the Atlantic we can get to Asia and then you know we'll have all this trade and we'll learn all these things and we can catch Islam on two fronts and do all these things and I'll be famous and I'll be the next Marco Polo and I had this vision that I could do this and and they were like you're insane because like we've consulted our scientists and they've been like it's twelve thousand miles away there's no way that we're going to and no like it's gonna take you way too long to get over to Japan you know you're gonna run out of food we're not going to fund this voyage that will you know the amount of cost that we would have to put into funding your voyage is is does not outweigh the risk of that all just being sunk all so you're like you're just a random sailor guy like we have a bigger fish to fry though a lot of people didn't note though it mm it's possible that they were just making him look better after the fact because they decided he was famous and cool now but a lot of people were like he's a very learned man you know he comes off as though he's very learned and he's you know kind of handsome he's got a bit of charisma to him but apparently not nearly enough charisma to get people to agree with him until finally it's the Spanish sovereigns who agree to it and it is not entirely clear why mostly because the only person who really talks about that is a guy named Oviedo who is not the most trustworthy source because he keeps you know bringing up like these fables as though they're history about how like ancient Spanish sovereigns journeyed across the ocean like thousands of years ago or something like this in order to so it's like really America was Spanish from the beginning all along and Columbus didn't really discover America he just rediscovered it no one really said he discovered America Oviedo like from the very beginning it's like he set out to make a fresh discovery of these islands because they all assumed well we discovered them before we just forgot about them because of the dark ages and stuff which is very interesting but it is right to accept this man to whom we owe so much as the prime mover of this great enterprise which he initiated for the benefit of all now living and those who shall live after us that's over yet Oh sort of saying kudos to Columbus and that is a thing to note by the way that Columbus the fact that he actually managed to establish relations complicated unpleasant relations especially in the end but it reinvigorated Europe so he in a very real sense he was very much like he kind of had this sort of hero's journey especially with the first voyage the first voyage is very kind of picturesque adventure because it ends happy where like so I'll actually described the voyage so he gets the Spanish Isabella and Ferdinand to fund his voyage and he's extremely gracious to him and he's like I'm gonna write this logbook so that I can account to you everything that happens and I can remain accountable to you and so they make this voyage and they start heading off and there's three ships he's in one of them and then there's these other two guys and the other ones who but by the way he had so many problems with like the people who he was working with like mutant against him at one point one of the ships just like when they were there in the islands one of the ships just like left and like we find out later it's because they just basically were like screw Columbus we're gonna go find some gold and this is they just took off with the ship and then later they found them and they'd found no gold and like I think somebody had died and like they were sick and they're like oh that we couldn't turn around because of the wind and Columbus is like I really want to smack you but I can't because I need you to like me like he kind of had that they had to deal with those diplomatic relations I keep jumping ahead of myself he goes sailing across the ocean one of the interesting things by the way that originally led me to wonder if he was an estp which is still possible I suppose no this is going to end up sounding kind of insulting the ESD peace I apologize is when they're crossing the ocean he he would write in his logbook the true calculation of how far they had gone during the day he would like write what that figure was but then when he reported to his men and the people on the other ships how far they'd gone he'd always whack off about 20% you know 15 to 20 percent to make it seem like they hadn't gone as far I think because he sort of knew he must have known to some degree that this voyage was going to be further than he probably said to people because he's just so driven I have to get to America because it really was not like fame and fortune yeah but the fame and fortune was more of like I think in his mind a reward for him doing what he really kind of felt God wanted him to do like he had this image of destiny so I relate that to not a dominant ni which would be more sophisticated and and where I would expect it to be more sophisticated I'd also expect him to have more nuance to to his visions of things maybe I'm prejudiced there but it sounds more like inferior and I where it's kind of gripped him and he only has the one vision and everything else is just him doing stuff to actualize that vision and it's you know hits why he'll wax poetical where you know in the later voyages he'd you know it almost sounds like he's losing his mind a little bit where he's talking about like um we're gonna find the young but you don't know if that's true you could just be being poetical but he starts you know talking about how he's gonna find the earthly paradise and he starts comparing things to like the Garden of Eden and you know in in a number of cases he would just sort of scuff off any evidence that contradicted the idea that he really had gotten to Asia like he sort of always thought he was supposed to because that was like the vision I'm gonna reach Asia there's a fascinating point along in the voyage where like he had to stop a mutiny and and as far as I can tell he had to stop the mutinies literally just by his charisma alone just his his overpowering just vision of we're going to get to the other land but also just as his energy and boisterousness that's another thing he worked himself to death like in the beginning he just very character in the beginning of his logbook you very casually is like so in order for me to both keep this journal make sure we're going on the right track do this and this I'll just I'll just have to not sleep cool no sleep and and he didn't sleep and this was not good because he made it harder for him to think clearly sometimes but he just like yeah and he also kind of had to because often his crew would be negligent another interesting another interesting thing is that he had an incredible sense of direction so he's always not always but occasionally I had heard that somewhere and it made sense and some of the passages in the logbook where he mentions you know he he had to correct where they were going even though they were following the compasses and things he like was even more correct just by like intuition or something like he he i'm a i'm i think i'm making him sound more like an anti-type and who knows maybe he was but i do think it was more of a dominant se with a very strong and i underneath it so anyway they travel across the ocean like i'd said before i think he knew it's probably farther than i've calculated but i'm gonna say that it's not as far because that way i can get the necessary people to be with me so i can get over there hence why he from the beginning by the way he does starts doing this very early he doesn't do it once he starts to realize or something like he starts doing it from the beginning so that indicates to me he knew this would probably be longer than he had told people so that there is that willingness to kind of do lies to yet to get to this vision so cuts off twenty percent of what he tells the crew they're on the how long are they on the ocean I wrote it down they the oh yeah two months it's two months before they seal and some of you have probably heard the story of how one of the sailors no not one of the sailors the admirer oh. yes the admirer ol Columbus who's the admirer oh he's the one who first sees this like candle light like this weird little light that's way out on the horizon just going up and down which is just a bizarre thing no one knows what's going on there but he saw it and a few other people confirmed it and Columbus was like that's land I know that's land and everyone else is like but I don't see any land him it's like I bet it's land whoever sees land first I will give them what did he say he was gonna give them a silk doublet I don't know what that is it sounds very valuable where is it oh yeah that's right yeah he promised a silk doublet to win on the stone castle its own saw it he said the same to Rodrigo. so yeah it's a little bit confusing here because he had made a promise that he would give a silk doublet to something valuable to whichever sailor caught sight of land first and one of the sailors did and Columbus just didn't give him the doublet which is a douchebag move but it's unclear partly because this is from Columbus's logbook which he wasn't just it's not like a private diary he's writing it for the king and queen so it would sound as though he recorded the fact that he himself did not give this man the doublet and let's casas who is sympathetic to Columbus also includes this and it's a little bit unclear if the reason that was is because Columbus believed that he himself had seen land because he saw the light going up and down though he didn't technically see the land I don't know it's an interesting little thing but it it does assuming that it's just simply like come on man just give him the stupid doublet like you promised it it's like ah like it reminds me a little bit of that moment between Thomas Edison who I D our lives anyway believes is in est P Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla we're excuse me Edison like promised you know this absurd amount of money actually I don't think it was that absurd but it was a very high amount of money to anybody who like did some kind of a may did some kind of an improvement or invention or did something and Tesla who was working in his laboratory at the time did it and was like okay so give me the money and Edison was like no that was a joke you don't really understand American humor do you you're not from around here I can tell from your accent you know and it's like slap slap you know but it's like it's hard to tell if he was justified there because it probably was just a joke but it's also like it's that willingness to kind of in the heat of the moment se will especially with est Pease there's very much a temptation to to make promises or wild claims just because it sounds really good and it really does reflect how you're feeling in the moment even though you kind of know in the back of your head and then definitely realize later that there's no way you can follow up on that like realistically so that's kind of the interesting relationship between ni and the SE you you'll still have that with ni types but not nearly as in the forefront and I think they often will hold back from that but as a types will often have trouble with not letting their inferior and I claims sort of run away with them I don't know that's just kind of my my approach in theory so anyway probably what you all are most interested in hearing is his relations with the with the natives so I'm just gonna I'm not even going to worry about typing at the moment I just want to run over the the relations with the Indian see it really irritates me because he has been presented as somebody who is like a murderous psychopath and that's just so completely uninformed and ignorant compared with what we see here in his writings and it completely it jube it makes the Indians juvenile you know that it's like you know I know that sounds odd but it's like it makes everybody one-dimensional it insults everybody because the Indians in this story are also very complicated people and they're not totally good they're capable of deceit and there's all these translation issues there's not just one tribe of like Avatar together with nature Indians there's like one tribe that is the arrow walks I believe they're called who were relatively peaceful and kind of lamb-like but also sort of like mendacious and they were willing to lie understandably because they didn't want to get killed it's kind of how they they were sort of being treated like sheep that were regularly rated by all of these tribes called the Caribes which is where we get the term Caribbean from because that's where Columbus landed he never got to the American mainland he was in the Caribbean islands which he of course thought was Asia India Japan wherever and would hold to that despite the evidence I think at one point he actually made some of his crew members I think it was on the third voyage he made some of his crew members like he forced them to sign some document like saying yes Columbus has discovered Asia we confirm this or something like this it's like come on dude look boy but anyways so he cut he they arrive and it's I it's fascinating because from the very start like they get to this island and a bunch of the airlocks are like holy crap there's this giant ship like this thing we've never seen before out there and they all come onto the beach and they're all naked you know for the most part and no one is older than thirty which is an interesting thing that the logbook missions it's sort of ominous of you know what's going on there but they all they all a bunch of these people show up on the shore and they're like and here's where it gets really interesting because we don't have anything written from the natives point of view right it's all from Columbus's point of view and occasionally there's some records from other people in Columbus so we never know like how do you know that's what the arrow walks were saying because he'll often interpret things like he was saying they were shouting like praises to God or praises to the sky and it's like how did you know that did they point at the sky because it's like I see you just interpreting them saying praise to God because you're you super devout Catholic by the way like there's so many things I'm not mentioning super devout Catholic like when they first saw thought they saw land when they were traveling over he like falls to his knees and his like Oh Lord thank you like on the ship he's sort of super dramatic and then they find out it was a cloud not really and um and they had like another like month and I have to go yeah that was pretty but he didn't ever let up like that never seemed like anything ever just made him despair there's one point on the voyage that I kept forgetting to say before where he literally like people were trying to mutiny against him and he was
