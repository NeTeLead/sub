ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort0,ENFJc,so I have this theory that
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort1,ENFJc,self-discipline begins with giving
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort2,ENFJc,yourself no other option or at least
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort3,ENFJc,making it harder for yourself to not
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort4,ENFJc,engage with the activity I used to be
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort5,ENFJc,absolutely the worst at any task that
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort6,ENFJc,required self-discipline going to the
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort7,ENFJc,gym every day no thanks
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort8,ENFJc,eating salads every day no thanks waking
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort9,ENFJc,up early absolutely actually back up I'm
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort10,ENFJc,still the absolute worst at
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort11,ENFJc,self-discipline so much so that I've
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort12,ENFJc,kind of hacked it in a way I found a way
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort13,ENFJc,around it a different solution so stick
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort14,ENFJc,with me here it might seem a little bit
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort15,ENFJc,extreme but I'll try to explain it as
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort16,ENFJc,best I can if I pack my gym bag at night
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort17,ENFJc,and I put my toiletries in it they're
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort18,ENFJc,the only toiletries I own and I put the
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort19,ENFJc,gym bag in the trunk of my car then in
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort20,ENFJc,the morning when I wake up I have two
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort21,ENFJc,choices either go outside in my pajamas
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort22,ENFJc,to get my gym bag and take out the
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort23,ENFJc,toiletries so I can take a shower at my
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort24,ENFJc,apartment before going to work or I can
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort25,ENFJc,simply get into the car and drive to the
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort26,ENFJc,gym and shower and brush my teeth there
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort27,ENFJc,after working out see if you construct
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort28,ENFJc,things like this so it feels far more
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort29,ENFJc,challenging to resist the action than to
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort30,ENFJc,just engage in the action then the
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort31,ENFJc,self-discipline is just gonna come
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort32,ENFJc,naturally we probably can all agree that
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort33,ENFJc,it's way easier to think about doing
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort34,ENFJc,something or to plan on doing something
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort35,ENFJc,compared to actually doing the thing so
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort36,ENFJc,just work on the planning side and let
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort37,ENFJc,the actually doing it follow seamlessly
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort38,ENFJc,after because I love taking the path of
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort39,ENFJc,least resistance that is something I am
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort40,ENFJc,very good at does that make sense let me
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort41,ENFJc,give you a few more examples if you
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort42,ENFJc,don't carry your credit card with you
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort43,ENFJc,you can't use your credit card if you
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort44,ENFJc,need to have the ability to buy things
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort45,ENFJc,when you're out you can limit your
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort46,ENFJc,spending by using cash if you have no
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort47,ENFJc,other food in your fridge except for
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort48,ENFJc,salad then you'll probably end up eating
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort49,ENFJc,salad if you put your alarm clock across
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort50,ENFJc,the room from you or even in a separate
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort51,ENFJc,room so you have to walk to it to turn
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort52,ENFJc,it off it's much more likely that you'll
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort53,ENFJc,be to awake at that point to go back to
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort54,ENFJc,bed and sleep longer hey maybe you can
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort55,ENFJc,get a couple of different alarm clocks
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort56,ENFJc,and make them lead you down the hall at
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort57,ENFJc,consecutive intervals so you're very far
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort58,ENFJc,from your bed by the time you're done
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort59,ENFJc,turning them all off focus on planning
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort60,ENFJc,rituals that make it much harder to
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort61,ENFJc,resist the activity than to engage with
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort62,ENFJc,it and the percentage of times that
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort63,ENFJc,you're going to actually do that
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort64,ENFJc,self-discipline tasks will automatically
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort65,ENFJc,increase here's one more example I hate
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort66,ENFJc,doing laundry but I only own enough
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort67,ENFJc,clothes for one week I have to do my
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort68,ENFJc,laundry every Sunday night or I have
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort69,ENFJc,nothing to wear to work on Monday
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort70,ENFJc,morning I have no choice and since I
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort71,ENFJc,have no choice I have no problem
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort72,ENFJc,following through with doing my laundry
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort73,ENFJc,every week the funny thing is that if I
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort74,ENFJc,tell this to people
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort75,ENFJc,it sounds like I'm super self
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort76,ENFJc,disciplined oh she does for laundry
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort77,ENFJc,every single Sunday at night the same
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort78,ENFJc,time every week that's amazing super
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort79,ENFJc,self disciplined but in reality that is
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort80,ENFJc,the absolute last time of the week that
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort81,ENFJc,I can do my laundry it is complete
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort82,ENFJc,procrastination so maybe the secret is
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort83,ENFJc,to stop trying to white-knuckle yourself
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort84,ENFJc,through self-discipline and think about
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort85,ENFJc,it in a different way constructing your
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort86,ENFJc,paths so that it would be the least
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort87,ENFJc,resistance to follow through with
ENFJc_Self-Discipline with Minimal Effort88,ENFJc,new activity until next time

ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)34,ENFJc,because I wanted to focus more time on

ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)107,ENFJc,timetables also come in to avoiding
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)108,ENFJc,procrastination so I will make a
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)109,ENFJc,timetable which is very strict it helps
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)110,ENFJc,to regulate my study session of my time
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)111,ENFJc,making sure that I don't procrastinate
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)112,ENFJc,and I don't give myself those empty

ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)114,ENFJc,without it being scheduled you know that
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)115,ENFJc,you're going to want to watch YouTube
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)116,ENFJc,videos you can put that into your

ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)120,ENFJc,keep on going and you don't really have
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)121,ENFJc,reason to procrastinate because
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)122,ENFJc,everything's already planned out for you
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)123,ENFJc,some really interesting psychology on
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)124,ENFJc,the idea of choices and when we have a
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)125,ENFJc,choice to do something if you eliminate
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)126,ENFJc,choice from your routine you don't have
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)127,ENFJc,the option to procrastinate and so
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)128,ENFJc,you're less likely to it's when you have
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)129,ENFJc,the choice of whether you're going to go
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)130,ENFJc,ahead with doing this essay or going on
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)131,ENFJc,your phone the or more likely to go on
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)132,ENFJc,your phone but if you don't give
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)133,ENFJc,yourself that choice then you're not
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)134,ENFJc,going to go on your phone okay now we're
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)135,ENFJc,going to go into flow which is the most
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)136,ENFJc,important thing when it comes to
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)137,ENFJc,studying for long hours or doing
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)138,ENFJc,anything for long hours
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)139,ENFJc,so in Camille Preston's that create more
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)140,ENFJc,flow she says more time and flow means
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)141,ENFJc,feeling great and creating great things
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)142,ENFJc,flow is that state where you are content
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)143,ENFJc,in what you are doing you are completely
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)144,ENFJc,focused you are completely invested and
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)145,ENFJc,it's quite a difficult state to get into
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)146,ENFJc,sometimes but I think that through the
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)147,ENFJc,motivation and avoiding procrastination
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)148,ENFJc,we can get into this state for me it was
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)149,ENFJc,always about finding flow if I didn't
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)150,ENFJc,have flow there was no way that I was
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)151,ENFJc,going to be able to sit down and study
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)152,ENFJc,for that long one component of this for
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)153,ENFJc,me was feeling relaxed if I felt
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)154,ENFJc,stressed I would never be able to study
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)155,ENFJc,for that long things began around in my
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)156,ENFJc,mind I wouldn't be able to commit myself
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)157,ENFJc,and focus my time focus my mind
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)158,ENFJc,entirely on on the task at hand the
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)159,ENFJc,thing that I would always recommend is
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)160,ENFJc,making sure that you are relaxed when
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)161,ENFJc,you start studying and that is a video
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)162,ENFJc,that's actually something I've spoken
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)163,ENFJc,about a bit in my video how to enjoy
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)164,ENFJc,studying where I talk about how I manage
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)165,ENFJc,to get into this state so do you go
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)166,ENFJc,check that out because I don't want to
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)167,ENFJc,repeat myself later okay so then a few
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)168,ENFJc,other bits that I want to focus on so
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)169,ENFJc,another thing that I would do which
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)170,ENFJc,would help me to keep walking for long
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)171,ENFJc,periods of time would be to switch
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)172,ENFJc,between activities and this doesn't
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)173,ENFJc,really work for everyone like I've had
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)174,ENFJc,some people say that this isn't isn't a
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)175,ENFJc,very effective strategy but it really
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)176,ENFJc,really works for me because it prevents
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)177,ENFJc,me from getting bored with anything so
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)178,ENFJc,you commit you commit to something you
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)179,ENFJc,are entirely focused but it's natural
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)180,ENFJc,that eventually you're going to start to
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)181,ENFJc,think okay this is getting a bit samey
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)182,ENFJc,say me I want I want some change so what
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)183,ENFJc,I would do is I would schedule my study
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)184,ENFJc,sessions so that I go between subjects I
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)185,ENFJc,go from chemistry to Spanish to English
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)186,ENFJc,rs and I just fluctuate between them so
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)187,ENFJc,it's not only with the subject so so I
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)188,ENFJc,would fluctuate between passive and
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)189,ENFJc,active revision and most importantly I
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)190,ENFJc,go between learning new things and
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)191,ENFJc,revising old things I'm like I love
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)192,ENFJc,learning I really love learning and the
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)193,ENFJc,part that I was found most tedious the
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)194,ENFJc,pot I still find most tedious about
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)195,ENFJc,studying is the fact that you've got to
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)196,ENFJc,spend so much time going over things you
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)197,ENFJc,already know and I like it when you're
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)198,ENFJc,when you're giving yourself new
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)199,ENFJc,opportunities to analyze or reflect or
ENFJc_How to Maintain Concentration (for as long as 14 hours!)200,ENFJc,you know widen your horizons with
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]0,ENFJc,in this course I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know to get started programming in
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]1,ENFJc,python.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]2,ENFJc,"Python is one of the most popular programming languages out there,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]3,ENFJc,and it's by far one of the most sought after for jobs
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]4,ENFJc,and so if you're trying to get a job
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]5,ENFJc,"or you're trying to you know,"

ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]7,ENFJc,or you try to write awesome scripts to do a bunch of different things than
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]8,ENFJc,python's for you
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]9,ENFJc,honestly
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]10,ENFJc,more and more developers every day are moving their projects over to python because it's such a powerful
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]11,ENFJc,and the surgeon
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]12,ENFJc,"easy to use language,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]13,ENFJc,a lot of programming languages out there just aren't very beginner friendly there's
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]14,ENFJc,a lot of syntax there's a lot of like little things that if you get wrong the program will yell at you.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]15,ENFJc,python is the complete
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]16,ENFJc,opposite of that.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]17,ENFJc,you basically just type out what you want to do in python does it it's that simple there's not
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]18,ENFJc,"a whole lot of syntax to learn the learning curve is literally zero you jump in,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]19,ENFJc,you can start writing your first program in seconds.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]20,ENFJc,in this course
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]21,ENFJc,I'm gonna teach you guys.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]22,ENFJc,everything you need to know to get started in python.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]23,ENFJc,I designed this course
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]24,ENFJc,"especially for python,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]25,ENFJc,and each lesson has been specially designed with examples
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]26,ENFJc,that will help you along the way.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]27,ENFJc,"with so many people starting to learn python the question isn't,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]28,ENFJc,why should you learn pipe on the question is why shouldn't you ?
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]29,ENFJc,and I think for a lot of people the reason they might not want to learn python is because they're intimidated or they're afraid that it's going to be too hard.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]30,ENFJc,trust me I am going to hold your hand through this entire course we're going to talk about all the core concepts in python we're going to look at
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]31,ENFJc,everything you need to know
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]32,ENFJc,to start programming in python and start being confidence are writing scripts and start writing programs that are awesome in doing cool things in your life.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]33,ENFJc,anyway
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]34,ENFJc,I'm super pumped to be teaching you guys python.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]35,ENFJc,I can't wait to get started in this course
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]36,ENFJc,and I hope you guys stick around and fall along with the course and learn this amazing programming language
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]37,ENFJc,in this tutorial dominates three guys how to install python onto your computer.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]38,ENFJc,and we're also going to install a text editor that we can use to write
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]39,ENFJc,our python programs
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]40,ENFJc,in.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]41,ENFJc,so the first order of business is to actually install
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]42,ENFJc,python on your computer.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]43,ENFJc,so we want to do is head over to your web browser
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]44,ENFJc,and
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]45,ENFJc,you want to go over here to this page it's just
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]46,ENFJc,www dot python dot org
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]47,ENFJc,forward slash
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]48,ENFJc,downloads
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]49,ENFJc,and on this
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]50,ENFJc,page there's
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]51,ENFJc,going to be
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]52,ENFJc,two buttons down here
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]53,ENFJc,and this is going to say download python three point six point three.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]54,ENFJc,and at least
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]55,ENFJc,the version that I have right now or download python two point seven point one four.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]56,ENFJc,so here's the thing about python there's actually two major versions of python
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]57,ENFJc,that are in use
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]58,ENFJc,currently
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]59,ENFJc,there is
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]60,ENFJc,python two
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]61,ENFJc,"and there's python theories you can see over here,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]62,ENFJc,this is like two point seven point one four
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]63,ENFJc,basically any python two
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]64,ENFJc,version we would just refer to as like python two
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]65,ENFJc,and here's like the latest
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]66,ENFJc,python three version.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]67,ENFJc,and so there's these two versions that you can download and the first thing we have to decide on which version do we want to download.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]68,ENFJc,and here's the basic difference
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]69,ENFJc,python
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]70,ENFJc,two
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]71,ENFJc,is a legacy version of python which basically means that
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]72,ENFJc,it's like an
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]73,ENFJc,old version and it's not being like actively maintained or supported
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]74,ENFJc,like officially by python anymore.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]75,ENFJc,python
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]76,ENFJc,three is like the future of python it's like the newest version it's the one that's getting actively maintained and supported.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]77,ENFJc,so there's pros and cons to picking either won
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]78,ENFJc,a lot of people say like python too
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]79,ENFJc,has been around longer and so there's more like
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]80,ENFJc,libraries there's basically just more python code written in python two
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]81,ENFJc,so therefore like there's a few more things that you can do in pipe onto then you can do in python three
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]82,ENFJc,but then again
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]83,ENFJc,"python two is not supported and you know,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]84,ENFJc,five or ten years from now
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]85,ENFJc,probably no one's going to be using it.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]86,ENFJc,python three it like a site is like the future of python it's the newest version it's the one that
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]87,ENFJc,you know it's sort of being maintained going forward.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]88,ENFJc,so for the purposes of this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]89,ENFJc,python
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]90,ENFJc,three
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]91,ENFJc,so we're going to want to download python
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]92,ENFJc,three
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]93,ENFJc,now here's vaguely
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]94,ENFJc,if you learn python three or you learn python to the differences aren't very big.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]95,ENFJc,there are a few differences in like some syntax and just so
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]96,ENFJc,"you know little things here and there,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]97,ENFJc,but if you learn python three you'll be able to jump right in and
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]98,ENFJc,code in python two as well don't let anyone
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]99,ENFJc,tell you that
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]100,ENFJc,you have to learn one of the other.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]101,ENFJc,we're going to learn python three just because it's I think probably the best for a beginner to learn.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]102,ENFJc,and so that's the one that we want to download so I'm just going to click download python three
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]103,ENFJc,and we're gonna go ahead and download
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]104,ENFJc,this version.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]105,ENFJc,and when that's done downloading I'm going to head down to my downloads folder
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]106,ENFJc,and you'll see here we just have this file
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]107,ENFJc,"doubleclick,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]108,ENFJc,"and we get this like python installer so I'm going to click through here,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]109,ENFJc,and we'll be able to install python three on our computer
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]110,ENFJc,right when that's done and stalling we can just close out of this and we should begin to get us now we have python three
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]111,ENFJc,installed on our computer.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]112,ENFJc,the next step
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]113,ENFJc,is we need to choose a text
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]114,ENFJc,editor so
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]115,ENFJc,we're going to be writing a bunch of code so we're going to need some you know environment of some program that we can write all that code in.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]116,ENFJc,"and really you can write python in any text editor you could write it in like a note pad or tax at it,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]117,ENFJc,it doesn't really matter
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]118,ENFJc,but there are special
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]119,ENFJc,text editors that are designed
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]120,ENFJc,just for writing python code.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]121,ENFJc,and these are called
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]122,ENFJc,id ease and not stands for
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]123,ENFJc,integrated development environment.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]124,ENFJc,it's basically just a special environment where we can you know ron and execute our python code.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]125,ENFJc,and it'll you know basically like tell us how we're doing so were
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]126,ENFJc,the only if we write something that's wrong or we
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]127,ENFJc,have errors it'll kind of
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]128,ENFJc,"point us in the right direction of what we need to do to fix that stuff,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]129,ENFJc,so in this course we're going to be using an idea
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]130,ENFJc,and
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]131,ENFJc,one of my favorites
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]132,ENFJc,and one of the most popular ity ease for python is called pi charm.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]133,ENFJc,so I'm over here on this website.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]134,ENFJc,it's called
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]135,ENFJc,jet brains
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]136,ENFJc,dotcom
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]137,ENFJc,forward slash
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]138,ENFJc,pi charm.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]139,ENFJc,and this is the idea that we're gonna be using in this course
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]140,ENFJc,so I'm just gonna come over here and click this big download
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]141,ENFJc,now button
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]142,ENFJc,and we'll go ahead and
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]143,ENFJc,download this
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]144,ENFJc,pie charm program
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]145,ENFJc,right so I'm getting this page are here you can see there's two versions of pi charm
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]146,ENFJc,one as a professional version and that one's like paid they have to pay for it.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]147,ENFJc,but then there's this community version down here and that's free and open source so I'm going to download this one
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]148,ENFJc,and this should have everything we need to get started using python
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]149,ENFJc,right when that finishes downloading I'm just going to
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]150,ENFJc,pull that up in my downloads folder
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]151,ENFJc,and
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]152,ENFJc,again we can just sort of
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]153,ENFJc,run this guy
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]154,ENFJc,and I'm on a mac so I'm going to have to drag it over to my applications folder.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]155,ENFJc,all right so now have pi charm
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]156,ENFJc,and we have python
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]157,ENFJc,three installed on your computer.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]158,ENFJc,so we're ready to start programming in
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]159,ENFJc,python.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]160,ENFJc,in this tutorial we're going to create our first
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]161,ENFJc,python program.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]162,ENFJc,and we're going to be able to run it and
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]163,ENFJc,see how everything works.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]164,ENFJc,the first thing I want to do is open up
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]165,ENFJc,pi charm so pi charm was the
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]166,ENFJc,idea he the
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]167,ENFJc,integrated development environment
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]168,ENFJc,that we downloaded in the last tutorial so
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]169,ENFJc,I'm just going to go out and search for it on my computer
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]170,ENFJc,and I can just open it up
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]171,ENFJc,and we first opened up high charm we should basically just get a window
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]172,ENFJc,prompting us to create a project.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]173,ENFJc,so you can see that down here.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]174,ENFJc,actually the first thing I want to do though is come over here to configure
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]175,ENFJc,and I'm just going to
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]176,ENFJc,click on preferences.
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]177,ENFJc,and I actually want to
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]178,ENFJc,change the appearance
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]179,ENFJc,so
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]180,ENFJc,I'm gonna go ahead and
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]181,ENFJc,give this a theme so I just went over here to appearance and behavior appearance
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]182,ENFJc,and I'm gonna change the theme to
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]183,ENFJc,darker color
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]184,ENFJc,because I think it's a little bit easier to
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]185,ENFJc,"use and look at,"
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]186,ENFJc,but you don't have to do that if you don't want you
ENFJc_Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]187,ENFJc,so

ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?54,ENFJc,them and then they grow up and realize
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?55,ENFJc,that there's more to just being an sjw
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?56,ENFJc,and really focus on developing a new
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?57,ENFJc,kind of philosophy not one that is
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?58,ENFJc,succumbing to the thrall of groupthink
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?59,ENFJc,that'd be nice but infps because of
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?60,ENFJc,their weakness of te inferior they are
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?61,ENFJc,very insecure about how their people
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?62,ENFJc,think of them and a lot of times they
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?63,ENFJc,actually draw their sense of self-worth
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?64,ENFJc,because of that insecurity it's it's
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?65,ENFJc,because they really want people think
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?66,ENFJc,highly of them and they want the status
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?67,ENFJc,that the end to be the status symbol of
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?68,ENFJc,people thinking highly of them I mean
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?69,ENFJc,why else do infps go out of their way
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?70,ENFJc,with their ESTJ subconscious to be like
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?71,ENFJc,that ultimate college professor you know
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?72,ENFJc,who's got a master's degree or a PhD
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?73,ENFJc,because infps really want to be
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?74,ENFJc,brilliant even though like they don't
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?75,ENFJc,give a damn about having a sense of
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?76,ENFJc,logic it's all just pure rationale in
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?77,ENFJc,the INFP land but that's okay they can
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?78,ENFJc,at least get the deployment that that
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?79,ENFJc,the diploma
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?80,ENFJc,that is kind of just like you know the
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?81,ENFJc,Scarecrow and prove that hey I have a
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?82,ENFJc,brain so you all have to respect me now
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?83,ENFJc,and then I'll be this amazing professor
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?84,ENFJc,at a college and regurgitate to you
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?85,ENFJc,everything I've learned with the filter
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?86,ENFJc,of my own personal philosophy to guide
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?87,ENFJc,me throughout that process right yeah
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?88,ENFJc,okay but to be fair though infps can
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?89,ENFJc,actually become super mega brilliant
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?90,ENFJc,with that and they can collect those
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?91,ENFJc,reference points and create something
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?92,ENFJc,completely original to be honest some of
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?93,ENFJc,the best literature i've ever read was
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?94,ENFJc,composed by infps and i am extremely
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?95,ENFJc,thankful for that one of my probably my
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?96,ENFJc,most favorite
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?97,ENFJc,infp that actually exists is Robert
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?98,ENFJc,Greene
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?99,ENFJc,he wrote the 48 laws of power
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?100,ENFJc,50th law mastery the art of seduction
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?101,ENFJc,[Music]
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?102,ENFJc,the 50th law which by the way the 50th
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?103,ENFJc,law in my opinion is his number one most
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?104,ENFJc,important book but you have to read all
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?105,ENFJc,of them basically if it was written by
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?106,ENFJc,Robert Greene you should be reading it
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?107,ENFJc,and if you're not I'm sorry but have
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?108,ENFJc,some self-respect and read those books
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?109,ENFJc,seriously I highly recommend it and no
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?110,ENFJc,I'm not getting like some random
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?111,ENFJc,compensation for this plug I would tell
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?112,ENFJc,anyone to read Robert Greene because
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?113,ENFJc,that's just the intelligent thing to do
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?114,ENFJc,because he really had knows his stuff
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?115,ENFJc,that si child is able to gather
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?116,ENFJc,reference points similarly to SI hero
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?117,ENFJc,like the ISTJ infps can actually become
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?118,ENFJc,it's very similar to is TJ's and that
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?119,ENFJc,they can be that walking library big
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?120,ENFJc,Alexandria it's not as strong as the
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?121,ENFJc,ISTJ because they're not doing it from
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?122,ENFJc,the point of collecting knowledge for
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?123,ENFJc,the sake of getting wisdom per se
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?124,ENFJc,they're collecting knowledge for the
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?125,ENFJc,sake of developing their personal
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?126,ENFJc,philosophy by taking all of the other
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?127,ENFJc,philosophies and they ever met choosing
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?128,ENFJc,or cherry-picking the best pieces of
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?129,ENFJc,that philosophy developing an entirely
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?130,ENFJc,new original philosophy and then
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?131,ENFJc,delivering it to everybody on a silver
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?132,ENFJc,platter oftentimes if people are going
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?133,ENFJc,to reject that silver platter they're
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?134,ENFJc,gonna pull out their whip and kind of
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?135,ENFJc,stuff it down their throats because
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?136,ENFJc,that's just how people are going to
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?137,ENFJc,respond to it with that ESTJ
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?138,ENFJc,subconscious but it's never from like a
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?139,ENFJc,negative intention it's because the INFP
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?140,ENFJc,feels it's their moral duty to do so and
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?141,ENFJc,quite frankly it really is it really is
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?142,ENFJc,the INF B's moral duty where do they get
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?143,ENFJc,that sense of moral duty well it comes
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?144,ENFJc,from the fact that you know fi hero is
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?145,ENFJc,all about morality they make decisions
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?146,ENFJc,based on what they believe is good or
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?147,ENFJc,bad they always know how they feel about
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?148,ENFJc,everything and because they're behind
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?149,ENFJc,the scenes they're like pretty silent so
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?150,ENFJc,just when you're in the presence of an
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?151,ENFJc,INFP just realize that they're always
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?152,ENFJc,silently judging you and they'll never
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?153,ENFJc,admit to it and if they do I mean at
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?154,ENFJc,least they're sincere but the truth is
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?155,ENFJc,they're always silently judging and you
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?156,ENFJc,just have to know that they're Fi heroes
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?157,ENFJc,they're judging you constantly always
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?158,ENFJc,I mean they kind of walk around
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?159,ENFJc,believing everyone around them is a bad
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?160,ENFJc,person anyway because no one can really
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?161,ENFJc,measure up to their AFI hero capability
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?162,ENFJc,except maybe like an infj or an is fgfe
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?163,ENFJc,parent somehow for some reason because
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?164,ENFJc,fi critic allows them to pass FB
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?165,ENFJc,nemesises reviewing stand for whatever
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?166,ENFJc,reason maybe it's because they're
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?167,ENFJc,holding themselves is this an insanely
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?168,ENFJc,high level personal standard to try to
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?169,ENFJc,be perfect and have perfection and then
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?170,ENFJc,the infps well like I'm already perfect
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?171,ENFJc,so I'm glad you're at least trying to be
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?172,ENFJc,perfect and that means we can work
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?173,ENFJc,together right yeah but but in all
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?174,ENFJc,seriousness infps are fantastic because
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?175,ENFJc,at least the infe can get that infj
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?176,ENFJc,right in front of them or that is F J
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?177,ENFJc,right from the FI Critic and just be
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?178,ENFJc,like hey by the way your standard is so
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?179,ENFJc,impossible maybe I could bring you back
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?180,ENFJc,down to earth over here you know we're
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?181,ENFJc,like the rest of us are and you can
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?182,ENFJc,follow my standard and utilize my
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?183,ENFJc,feelings as a standard with which you
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?184,ENFJc,always know what your boundaries are
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?185,ENFJc,because if I'm feeling bad about
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?186,ENFJc,something you know something is wrong
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?187,ENFJc,and you probably should change your
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?188,ENFJc,behavior that's why fi critic really
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?189,ENFJc,needs to have a strong IFP around and
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?190,ENFJc,that's either isfp or with the ENFP Wow
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?191,ENFJc,allergies are just crazy right now of
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?192,ENFJc,course that's what you get when you film
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?193,ENFJc,out you know with all the doors open and
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?194,ENFJc,it's springtime hey oh well so anyway
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?195,ENFJc,that's fi hero any parent is really
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?196,ENFJc,awesome it allows them to reach out into
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?197,ENFJc,the ether because it's very metaphysical
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?198,ENFJc,having metaphysical conversations about
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?199,ENFJc,the collective unconscious and the
ENFJc_Who Are The INFPs?200,ENFJc,collective feature of man as we know it
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad0,ENFJ,"Hey! so my name is Jess. I'm a mechanical engineering student, master student at"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad1,ENFJ,"ETH Zurich and today I'm going to be
filming the day a day in a life of a"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad2,ENFJ,"mechanical engineer because looks like a
lot of people are hungry to see it and"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad3,ENFJ,"also today I get to do experiments. So
usually I do a lot of simulations, which"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad4,ENFJ,"you will see later. But today I get to do
experiments to back up my simulations"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad5,ENFJ,"which you will also see later if I get
permission from my Prof. Also if you're"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad6,ENFJ,"wondering no didn't go to the gym this
morning because I was too tired"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad7,ENFJ,"#engineeringlife lol. Okay maybe
I'll explain my simulations a little bit"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad8,ENFJ,"so I am like simulating a gas turbine or
like a burner within a gas turbine and"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad9,ENFJ,"it has two flames in it so I already
simulated the burner like in using"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad10,ENFJ,"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) or
Large Eddy Simulation (LES)"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad11,ENFJ,"so now what I'm doing is I'm gonna
be doing the experiments to sort of"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad12,ENFJ,"verify my simulations so it makes sense
you'll see. So now we are approaching ETH"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad13,ENFJ,"That's the main building. That's my
building. Main building is much more beautiful."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad14,ENFJ,"So here this is a giant engine
we have. You can see, it's pretty dope"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad15,ENFJ,"Pretty big. And so this is pretty much
what I do. General Electric Swissair, cool"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad16,ENFJ,huh hand for scale
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad17,ENFJ,"okay so I'm in my office and I'm gonna
show you some of my simulation."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad18,ENFJ,There we go. So this is the first flame. This is like the temperature of the flame
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad19,ENFJ,So the red part is the hot part. Here we have the oxygen and then here we have the fuel.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad20,ENFJ,"So obviously when the fuel
burns there's no more fuel inside the flame."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad21,ENFJ,"So that's why it's white on the
inside"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad22,ENFJ,"Same with the oxygen. It's blue on the
inside because there's no oxygen once it"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad23,ENFJ,"burns. Because we're burning ""fuel lean"". And so this is my first flame and now"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad24,ENFJ,"I'll show you my second flame. So now you can
see my two flames so this is the flame I"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad25,ENFJ,"just show you it's kind of going crazy
here. Here I have extra air coming in and"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad26,ENFJ,"here I have extra fuel coming in and
because the flow is so hot there is the"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad27,ENFJ,"second flame that's forming so you can
see it's kind of like a dragon"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad28,ENFJ,"And so it's pumping and this is an instability.
So do you see that?"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad29,ENFJ,"Yeah, so if you have, I guess, any more
questions about this, you can just like"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad30,ENFJ,"comment below. Yeah, pretty much that's my project and I think it's pretty cool."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad31,ENFJ,"I think we can duplicate it in experiments
it would be way cooler so I'm gonna ask"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad32,ENFJ,"my supervisor if I could do that. Yes,
so stay tuned."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad33,ENFJ,"So this is my friend, Luigi, from Italy.
Luigi, where are you from? What is your name?"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad34,ENFJ,"It's Luigi. Like you told it. And ya, I'm from Italy."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad35,ENFJ,From Italy!
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad36,ENFJ,I didn't do that.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad37,ENFJ,Could you please stop the video? Or do you have to go through my whole life?
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad38,ENFJ,"So, this is your
mechanical engineering project."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad39,ENFJ,Ya.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad40,ENFJ,A grey screen.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad41,ENFJ,Exactly
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad42,ENFJ,"So here I'm inside the
control room of our burner."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad43,ENFJ,I should be looking at the camera
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad44,ENFJ,Here's my supervisor checking on the test rig.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad45,ENFJ,I didn't want to use my own footage because I didn't want to get in trouble.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad46,ENFJ,So this is the footage from my lab's website.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad47,ENFJ,"Pretty much I don't know what you
want me to tell you. I just finished the"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad48,ENFJ,"experiments. Now I'm extracting data. I'm
gonna put into a presentation pretty fun"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad49,ENFJ,Life of an engineering student.
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad50,ENFJ,So this is the Messung von Verweilzeitspektren?
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad51,ENFJ,"Clearly, you know exactly
what that means"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad52,ENFJ,"What is this thing called, a scrubber?
When you try to like separate"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad53,ENFJ,NOx or CO2 from air or from exhaust gas. So pretty much I'm pretty sure like the
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad54,ENFJ,"exhaust goes from the bottom up here.
This material is some sort of absorbent"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad55,ENFJ,"material that absorbs the NOx or the
exhaust"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad56,ENFJ,"the clean gas exits or something like
that"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad57,ENFJ,"actually I decided this is a good thing
to explain so yeah pretty much this is"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad58,ENFJ,"exactly what we're doing here we have
our first-stage burner and this is the test rig"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad59,ENFJ,and here we have the second flame and so these two planes interact together and
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad60,ENFJ,"they create like acoustic modes and so
this is the test rig that I am"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad61,ENFJ,simulating right now. So I'm simulating it here you can see
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad62,ENFJ,"that this is flame.
So this is exactly what I'm simulating that"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad63,ENFJ,"I showed earlier. Or this is another way
to visualize the exact same simulation"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad64,ENFJ,"yeah you can use high speed laser
Diagnostics to view it in the experiment"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad65,ENFJ,"so this is a
simulation and this is what"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad66,ENFJ,"you used to see the experiment so you'd
pretty much seed the flow with some sort"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad67,ENFJ,"of fluorescent material then you use the
laser to make it fluoresce so make the"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad68,ENFJ,"light, make like the whatever you see it
with"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad69,ENFJ,"fluoresce in a different color and then
use high-speed camera to record and so"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad70,ENFJ,"the application is for like these
different gas turbine engines so you can"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad71,ENFJ,"see here you have the first flame and
the second flame. That's pretty much the"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad72,ENFJ,"application of this burner. Yeah there we
go again, one flame, second flame."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad73,ENFJ,"Well, there's three and two but you know what
I mean"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad74,ENFJ,"And this is the motivation behind it
pretty much we were burning oil, gas and"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad75,ENFJ,"coal and we're always going to keep
burning them till we run out so and on"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad76,ENFJ,"top of that wind and solar are very
sporadic but this is the demand so this"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad77,ENFJ,"is constant but renewables are not
constant so we have to figure out a way"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad78,ENFJ,"which is gas turbines and burning gas
oil and coal and we have to use these"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad79,ENFJ,"pretty much to make up for this demand,
when we don't have renewables available"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad80,ENFJ,"So that's the point of
yeah so pretty much yeah that's why we"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad81,ENFJ,"use gas turbines still and so what we're
trying to do is just make this more"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad82,ENFJ,"efficient so one way to make them more
efficient is to use two flames but in"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad83,ENFJ,"order to do that we have to investigate
with two flames in the burner which is"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad84,ENFJ,"what I'm doing
That's it."
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad85,ENFJ,"Yeah pretty much that's my life as a mechanical engineering student
at ETH Zurich"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad86,ENFJ,"that evening I didn't really do much I
came home I ate a salad and then I"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad87,ENFJ,watched Parks and Recreation. Let me know below if you're a mechanical engineer
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad88,ENFJ,"and if your student life is different
chances are that if you're in your"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad89,ENFJ,"bachelors it's way more packed than mine.
Yeah and also like and subscribe"
ENFJ_Day in the Life of a Mechanical Engineering Student | Engineering Study Abroad90,ENFJ,"I just recently made friends with
EverythingKay and she is in computer"

ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test0,ENFP,hello guys what's up Bogdan here you're
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test1,ENFP,sixteen personalities guy I'm gonna do
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test2,ENFP,something a little bit different today
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test3,ENFP,based on the comments and requests I've
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test4,ENFP,been getting from you guys to make a
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test5,ENFP,video about my personality type reveal
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test6,ENFP,here we go drumroll please my
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test7,ENFP,personality type is I don't know I don't
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test8,ENFP,know what my personality type is as I've
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test9,ENFP,said to some of you already I have taken
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test10,ENFP,the test before twice two different
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test11,ENFP,kinds of tests some of you have been
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test12,ENFP,asking me to record myself taking a test
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test13,ENFP,which we're gonna do later but before we
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test14,ENFP,do that I want to just give a brief
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test15,ENFP,introduction about me taking the test
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test16,ENFP,previously the first time I took it was
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test17,ENFP,a long time ago when I was 16 for a
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test18,ENFP,school assignment where we all had to
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test19,ENFP,take the personality test and I got the
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test20,ENFP,infj and when I read about it I thought
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test21,ENFP,I I felt that this was very accurate but
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test22,ENFP,hold on don't get too excited fast
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test23,ENFP,forward to about a year and a half ago I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test24,ENFP,met a guy who is now my friend we we
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test25,ENFP,started talking about personality types
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test26,ENFP,I didn't know anything about it like but
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test27,ENFP,but he did and had read a lot about it
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test28,ENFP,and so on
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test29,ENFP,and he told me that I was an INTP and I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test30,ENFP,said no no I took the test
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test31,ENFP,I'm an infj and he said no your 90p the
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test32,ENFP,next day I read about the INTP and I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test33,ENFP,just felt this was so accurate and so
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test34,ENFP,correct like they were inside my head
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test35,ENFP,you know as I'm sure a lot of you have
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test36,ENFP,felt and then after reading the INTP I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test37,ENFP,decided to take the test again which I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test38,ENFP,did and I got the infj as I was reading
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test39,ENFP,about the infj I felt that it was not as
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test40,ENFP,accurate as the INTP so ultimately I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test41,ENFP,trusted my friend the guy who told me
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test42,ENFP,that I was an INTP more than taking an
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test43,ENFP,online test
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test44,ENFP,I've had multiple times it's happened
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test45,ENFP,where my friends have taken the test and
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test46,ENFP,they come up to me and say hey look this
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test47,ENFP,this is what I got and I say nope that's
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test48,ENFP,just wrong I mean it's
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test49,ENFP,I've heard before the first step into
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test50,ENFP,finding out which personality type you
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test51,ENFP,are is to take the test and see which
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test52,ENFP,one you're not I think it's correct if
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test53,ENFP,there's a person who's very intuitive
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test54,ENFP,and knows a lot about the personality
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test55,ENFP,types if they can tell if they tell you
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test56,ENFP,what you are I think that's much more
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test57,ENFP,accurate than taking a test after
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test58,ENFP,reading about the infj and the INTP I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test59,ENFP,decided to read about all of them and
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test60,ENFP,that's how I began to study personality
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test61,ENFP,types and all that another one that I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test62,ENFP,really thought was accurate to me was I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test63,ENFP,STP you know well know INFP is also one
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test64,ENFP,as I was reading I felt that this was
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test65,ENFP,just so accurate and I felt that it was
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test66,ENFP,more true about me than the others and
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test67,ENFP,so for a long time I thought that I was
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test68,ENFP,INFP maybe that's what I am long story
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test69,ENFP,short I don't know what I am I don't
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test70,ENFP,think that one can know oneself who they
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test71,ENFP,are but by going in and trying to figure
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test72,ENFP,out who you are there's a lot of bias
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test73,ENFP,there you're only seeing from one
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test74,ENFP,perspective from your perspective and so
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test75,ENFP,I think it's much more accurate if there
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test76,ENFP,is a person out there very intuitive who
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test77,ENFP,can tell who can look at you and say oh
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test78,ENFP,this is what you are so without further
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test79,ENFP,ado let's go take the test
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test80,ENFP,ok so I am here at the 16 personalities
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test81,ENFP,website I I just decided to go with this
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test82,ENFP,one I'm just just for the fun of it
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test83,ENFP,let's just let's take the test here and
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test84,ENFP,so you guys can see I guess what's
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test85,ENFP,what's in my mind the first question is
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test86,ENFP,you find it difficult to introduce
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test87,ENFP,yourself to other people mm-hmm not
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test88,ENFP,really I never really had a problem with
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test89,ENFP,introducing myself so I'm just I'll just
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test90,ENFP,click this one right here you often get
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test91,ENFP,so lost in thoughts that you ignore or
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test92,ENFP,forget your surroundings
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test93,ENFP,I do get lost in my thoughts but I'm
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test94,ENFP,very self aware I'm kind of neurotic not
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test95,ENFP,as much as I used to be so I can be
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test96,ENFP,thinking about something and be lost in
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test97,ENFP,thought but as soon as some something
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test98,ENFP,pops up that needs attention I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test99,ENFP,immediately turn to it and strongly
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test100,ENFP,disagree you try to respond to your
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test101,ENFP,emails as soon as possible and cannot
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test102,ENFP,stand a messy inbox

ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test104,ENFP,keep my email very organized well
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test105,ENFP,anything really organized but I don't
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test106,ENFP,respond to emails as soon as possible
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test107,ENFP,this one right here mildly agree you
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test108,ENFP,find it easy to stay relaxed even when
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test109,ENFP,there is some pressure recently this has
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test110,ENFP,been easier to do to stay relaxed when
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test111,ENFP,there is more and more pressure so I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test112,ENFP,guess I would say yes I do you do not
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test113,ENFP,usually initiate conversations my whole
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test114,ENFP,life I have never been a conversation
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test115,ENFP,initiator never but recently yes I have
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test116,ENFP,it's been easier to just sort of walk up
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test117,ENFP,to people I've been developing more of
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test118,ENFP,my extroverted enos I'm gonna go with
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test119,ENFP,this one you rarely do something just
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test120,ENFP,out of sheer curiosity yeah that's true
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test121,ENFP,I don't like to do things just out of
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test122,ENFP,you know let's see what will happen I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test123,ENFP,kind of like to have a reason but there
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test124,ENFP,is also a
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test125,ENFP,a spontaneity which I enjoy and
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test126,ENFP,impulsivity to a certain degree let's do
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test127,ENFP,this one next I honestly don't know if
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test128,ENFP,I'm answering honestly or not let's see
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test129,ENFP,I'm trying to you feel superior to other
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test130,ENFP,people what some I'm just gonna be
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test131,ENFP,honest here and go with that one because
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test132,ENFP,I do kind of feel superior to other
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test133,ENFP,people it's a flaw it's um it's
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test134,ENFP,something wrong definitely but just
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test135,ENFP,inside there's that you know pride in
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test136,ENFP,that ego if I'm gonna be honest here
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test137,ENFP,then I'm just gonna go with that one I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test138,ENFP,don't like it and I'm working on it
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test139,ENFP,being organized is more important to you
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test140,ENFP,than being adaptable mm-hmm no adaptable
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test141,ENFP,is more important to me you are usually
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test142,ENFP,highly motivated and energetic not not
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test143,ENFP,really it really depends on what it is
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test144,ENFP,which I you know I think goes for all of
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test145,ENFP,us but not usually I'm not too energetic
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test146,ENFP,or highly motivated about a lot of
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test147,ENFP,things I think it's that introverted
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test148,ENFP,miss no winning a debate matters less to
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test149,ENFP,you than making sure no one gets upset I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test150,ENFP,do like winning my debates and being
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test151,ENFP,right that could be a thinking trait I'm
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test152,ENFP,gonna go with strongly disagree you
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test153,ENFP,often feel as if you have to justify
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test154,ENFP,yourself to other people at the end of
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test155,ENFP,the day I feel like you know I don't
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test156,ENFP,have to explain myself to people I'm
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test157,ENFP,gonna go with this one right here
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test158,ENFP,because there are times when you do have
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test159,ENFP,to justify yourself I think your home
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test160,ENFP,and work environments are quite tidy yes
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test161,ENFP,I try to stay very organized I'm kind of
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test162,ENFP,a clean freak I like to stay very clean
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test163,ENFP,and organized you do not mind being at
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test164,ENFP,the center of attention I do not mind
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test165,ENFP,being at the center of attention I like
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test166,ENFP,attention so you consider yourself more
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test167,ENFP,practical than creative
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test168,ENFP,no it is often difficult for you to
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test169,ENFP,relate to other people's feelings no I
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test170,ENFP,feel like I relate very strongly to
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test171,ENFP,other people's feelings but I just
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test172,ENFP,oftentimes I don't really know how to
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test173,ENFP,deal with people's feelings sorry my dog
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test174,ENFP,is walking around here so you might hear
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test175,ENFP,his claw sounds your mood can change
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test176,ENFP,very quickly I'm gonna go with this one
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test177,ENFP,right here my mood can change very
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test178,ENFP,easily but it's just one of the things
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test179,ENFP,that I try really hard and to control to
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test180,ENFP,not let that happen to to stay more
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test181,ENFP,stable next in a discussion truth should
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test182,ENFP,be more important than people's
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test183,ENFP,sensitive sensitivities yeah I I think
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test184,ENFP,that's very true truth should be more
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test185,ENFP,important so I very strongly agree you
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test186,ENFP,rarely worry about how your actions
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test187,ENFP,affect other people and that's not true
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test188,ENFP,I do worry about how my actions affect
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test189,ENFP,others a lot I think that's how I've
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test190,ENFP,spent most of my life probably an
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test191,ENFP,interesting book or a video game is
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test192,ENFP,often better than a social event as a
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test193,ENFP,kid I would immediately go to the
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test194,ENFP,strongly agree an interesting book would
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test195,ENFP,have been way better to me than a social
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test196,ENFP,event very introverted I was a bookworm
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test197,ENFP,and social events were not my thing
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test198,ENFP,my introverted side does prefer kind of
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test199,ENFP,a quiet moment alone to myself being by
ENFP_My Personality and Taking the Test200,ENFP,myself rather than social events you

"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 219",ENTJ,make sure that you're using your points
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 220",ENTJ,correctly instead of just dumping them
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 221",ENTJ,in the wrong places at the wrong time
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 222",ENTJ,what I mean by that is you don't want to
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 223",ENTJ,be dumping points into twister instead
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 224",ENTJ,of tornado first you want to make sure
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 225",ENTJ,you put points in the tornado first
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 226",ENTJ,because you're gonna be using tornado in
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 227",ENTJ,that twister so as we go along with the
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 228",ENTJ,build you want to put this is very young
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 229",ENTJ,game like I said guys so you want to put
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 230",ENTJ,20 points in the cyclone armor 20
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 231",ENTJ,twister 20 tornado 20 hurricane and 20
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 232",ENTJ,oak sage and then you get a little bit
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 233",ENTJ,more extra points left over and actually
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 234",ENTJ,put that in the summon grizzly I'm
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 235",ENTJ,actually a little bit too lazy to summon
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 236",ENTJ,them just because I don't want to really
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 237",ENTJ,but I never really used a windy druid
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 238",ENTJ,that had that many points left over to
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 239",ENTJ,where he could put points in to summon
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 240",ENTJ,grizzly so if you wanted to do that you
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 241",ENTJ,can go ahead and do that as well so this
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 242",ENTJ,is very basic gear guys I'm using the
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 243",ENTJ,Shaco helm right now and that's probably
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 244",ENTJ,one of the biggest things I want to
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 245",ENTJ,point out to you guys because with a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 246",ENTJ,druid you can actually get a druid helm
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 247",ENTJ,and a lot of these two Tom's cuz that
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 248",ENTJ,could have some really nice stats on
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 249",ENTJ,that like to the Drude skills through
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 250",ENTJ,the tornado things like that and those
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 251",ENTJ,are actually really hard to come by in
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 252",ENTJ,the trading community I mean some people
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 253",ENTJ,keep them you can actually make a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 254",ENTJ,delirium you can get like 3/2 tornado on
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 255",ENTJ,a white druid home that make a delirium
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 256",ENTJ,that'll actually give you about five
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 257",ENTJ,skill levels two tornado that's a little
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 258",ENTJ,bit different some people just go with
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 259",ENTJ,Shaco because they like the magic find
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 260",ENTJ,and things like that so this is actually
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 261",ENTJ,very basic gear and this isn't anything
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 262",ENTJ,too crazy so I'm actually using hodo
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 263",ENTJ,Shaco maras you could actually get a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 264",ENTJ,little bit more damage out of it if you
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 265",ENTJ,went with a 3-2 elemental skills amulet
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 266",ENTJ,but that's really not necessary I mean
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 267",ENTJ,one skill is gonna make or break your
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 268",ENTJ,character but I mean Mars is really nice
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 269",ENTJ,for
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 270",ENTJ,thirty resistances and their attributes
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 271",ENTJ,and things like that I'm using a nygma
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 272",ENTJ,spirit shield war traveler boots stone
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 273",ENTJ,the Jordan Iraq the mesh and mage fist
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 274",ENTJ,gloves that's which I got called arms
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 275",ENTJ,and spirit and all I'm elemental skill
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 276",ENTJ,green charms and II and the torch and
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 277",ENTJ,then on the mercenary I'm using the
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 278",ENTJ,Infinity treachery and vampire case so
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 279",ENTJ,one thing I wanted to point out with
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 280",ENTJ,infinity this really doesn't help out a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 281",ENTJ,druid that much it's really only gonna
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 282",ENTJ,help out the hurricane damage and that's
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 283",ENTJ,only if there's non cold immune monsters
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 284",ENTJ,so one of the biggest things that's a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 285",ENTJ,problem with kolduny monsters is it's
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 286",ENTJ,really hard to break the cold immunities
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 287",ENTJ,on those monsters so a lot of people ask
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 288",ENTJ,all the time in the Diablo 2 community
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 289",ENTJ,how do you break cold immunities in
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 290",ENTJ,Diablo 2 and the answer to that is
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 291",ENTJ,there's only two things that actually
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 292",ENTJ,apply to route to removing resistances
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 293",ENTJ,from a monster in the game and that's a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 294",ENTJ,lower resist which has occurs from a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 295",ENTJ,necromancer
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 296",ENTJ,it's a necromancer spell but you could
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 297",ENTJ,get it on the wand and conviction which
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 298",ENTJ,is a paladin aura or that's on infinity
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 299",ENTJ,so even with infinity and the lower
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2100",ENTJ,resists combined together I really don't
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2101",ENTJ,think that's I'm not too sure you guys
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2102",ENTJ,might have to look that up I don't think
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2103",ENTJ,that that's enough resistances negative
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2104",ENTJ,resistance is to actually take the cold
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2105",ENTJ,immunities off and actually tried
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2106",ENTJ,testing it and it didn't work
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2107",ENTJ,and what I did is I actually used a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2108",ENTJ,conviction where I from a paladin I use
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2109",ENTJ,lower assist and I actually took off
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2110",ENTJ,some of the cold immunities from there
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2111",ENTJ,and and that's really hard to come by I
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2112",ENTJ,mean a lot of people don't play
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2113",ENTJ,conviction paladin's or anything like
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2114",ENTJ,that anymore or origins so that's really
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2115",ENTJ,something that that's kind of a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2116",ENTJ,disadvantage to a lot of people that do
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2117",ENTJ,cold damage in Diablo 2 is because so
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2118",ENTJ,many monsters and hell mode have very
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2119",ENTJ,high resistances so you really can't
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2120",ENTJ,break their their resistances and take
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2121",ENTJ,that cold immunity off because you don't
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2122",ENTJ,have enough negative resistance on that
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2123",ENTJ,monster to take it off lightning damage
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2124",ENTJ,and fire damage is a little bit
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2125",ENTJ,different because lightning damage a lot
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2126",ENTJ,of the monsters in Diablo 2 do not have
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2127",ENTJ,as much lightning resist as they do cold
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2128",ENTJ,resists and that's why lightning can get
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2129",ENTJ,can get removed from monsters and cold
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2130",ENTJ,damage most of the time can
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2131",ENTJ,so I'm just gonna make sure that the
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2132",ENTJ,players are set to eight and then we'll
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2133",ENTJ,get it started so what the oaks age
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2134",ENTJ,right now I got about six thousand six
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2135",ENTJ,thousand six hundred health I'm doing
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2136",ENTJ,six point eight K damage on the
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2137",ENTJ,tornadoes and 3k damage on the hurricane
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2138",ENTJ,so we're just gonna go the world some
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2139",ENTJ,keep instead and I'll show you guys
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2140",ENTJ,as you can see there with those snakes
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2141",ENTJ,that little snake back and took them out
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2142",ENTJ,pretty quick there
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2143",ENTJ,and there's actually a lot of these I
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2144",ENTJ,spawn deeds it's weird
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2145",ENTJ,really don't like how those guys give
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2146",ENTJ,you like no items oh my gosh and another
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2147",ENTJ,pack of them it's a third pack I've seen
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2148",ENTJ,so as you can see I mean they take out
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2149",ENTJ,everything very easily one of the nice
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2150",ENTJ,things about tornadoes as well as that
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2151",ENTJ,does physical damage and a lot of
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2152",ENTJ,monsters in Diablo 2 aren't immune to
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2153",ENTJ,physical damage so most the time you can
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2154",ENTJ,just go around and kill whatever you
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2155",ENTJ,want as to where some other bills in
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2156",ENTJ,Diablo - like a cold sorceress for
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2157",ENTJ,example really can't go around killing
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2158",ENTJ,many things in Diablo - just because
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2159",ENTJ,there's so many cold immunities and with
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2160",ENTJ,a windy druid I mean it's it's really
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2161",ENTJ,nice to just be able to go around and
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2162",ENTJ,fight whatever whatever monster you want
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2163",ENTJ,and actually get away with it we're a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2164",ENTJ,cold sorceress you you just you can't do
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2165",ENTJ,that alright so moving on the number
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2166",ENTJ,four is the trap the SATs and traps
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2167",ENTJ,essence is definitely one of the most
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2168",ENTJ,overpowered classes in the game and
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2169",ENTJ,builds in the game that I really don't
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2170",ENTJ,see a lot of people playing I mean you
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2171",ENTJ,could really get away with making a
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2172",ENTJ,awesome character for a lot cheaper than
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2173",ENTJ,a hammer tin se or a sorceress going
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2174",ENTJ,over the gear with you guys real quick
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2175",ENTJ,so this is the biggest thing I want to
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2176",ENTJ,talk about with this build is the
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2177",ENTJ,silence face plate know a lot of people
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2178",ENTJ,go ahead and use hodo and things like
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2179",ENTJ,that but this is a really big thing with
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2180",ENTJ,trap assassins I had to learn this the
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2181",ENTJ,hard way when I first started playing
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2182",ENTJ,assassins is that your your casting
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2183",ENTJ,speed for your traps is not based on
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2184",ENTJ,your faster castrate it's based on your
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2185",ENTJ,attack speed so you really want to make
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2186",ENTJ,sure that you have a weapon that has
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2187",ENTJ,very fast attack speed such as the phase
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2188",ENTJ,blade and that's why I made a silence in
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2189",ENTJ,the face plate so silence is really nice
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2190",ENTJ,gives to doll skills and that massive
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2191",ENTJ,75% to all resistances and it's a really
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2192",ENTJ,nice base weapon right there the face
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2193",ENTJ,plate so you're really going to be
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2194",ENTJ,casting your traps really fast but at
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2195",ENTJ,the same time it's also nice to have
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2196",ENTJ,faster cash rate just so you could
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2197",ENTJ,teleport around really quickly when
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2198",ENTJ,using enigma
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2199",ENTJ,so obviously I'm using a dig my shaco
"ENTJ_Fastest Killing Builds in Diablo 2 (Information, History Walk through) - 디아블로 2200",ENTJ,Amara's spirit war traveler boots to

ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY12,ENTJ,that complicated but at least I'm picky
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY13,ENTJ,and that's mostly because of some
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY14,ENTJ,previous experiences that I've had easy
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY15,ENTJ,as that so for you guys today I have
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY16,ENTJ,what I look for in a guy

ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY20,ENTJ,hear about the Italian chef that died he
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY21,ENTJ,passed away now usually takes me about
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY22,ENTJ,one minute to know if the guy has the
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY23,ENTJ,same sense of humor and that is mostly
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY24,ENTJ,because I use sarcasm a lot but a great
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY25,ENTJ,sense of humor is really important to me
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY26,ENTJ,because I love having a good laugh and
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY27,ENTJ,just having fun and smiling in general
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY28,ENTJ,it also most certainly brings out a
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY29,ENTJ,better side of me and it makes me feel
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY30,ENTJ,super comfortable number two something I
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY31,ENTJ,really like is when guys are a little
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY32,ENTJ,bit spontaneous nothing crazy but just
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY33,ENTJ,like a hey it's 10:00 p.m. wanna grab

ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY40,ENTJ,about something whether it's skating
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY41,ENTJ,cars making music training or whatever
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY42,ENTJ,anything really as long as you're
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY43,ENTJ,passionate about something I find it
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY44,ENTJ,incredibly attractive and the reason for
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY45,ENTJ,this is that when I like something I
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY46,ENTJ,usually get really passionate about them
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY47,ENTJ,number four is good grooming this is
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY48,ENTJ,very important to me and I take it quite

ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY54,ENTJ,everybody does it and
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY55,ENTJ,hirable like to me this exact thing is
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY56,ENTJ,just common sense but that's certainly
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY57,ENTJ,not the case for everybody
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY58,ENTJ,number 5 is confidence now this one is a
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY59,ENTJ,little bit tricky because i'm shy'
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY60,ENTJ,myself but I really enjoy when a person
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY61,ENTJ,can make me feel comfortable by just
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY62,ENTJ,having a simple conversation I really
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY63,ENTJ,like when a guy can take away my
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY64,ENTJ,nervousness and that's only possible if
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY65,ENTJ,they're confident so just be confident
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY66,ENTJ,number 6 has to do with respect and by
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY67,ENTJ,that I specifically mean that a guy
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY68,ENTJ,respects what I do I really like when
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY69,ENTJ,guys pay attention to what I say and
ENTJ_WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY70,ENTJ,show interests in what I do more

"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel0",ENTJ,[Music]
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel1",ENTJ,[Music]
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel2",ENTJ,so I got a one wheel last week so I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel3",ENTJ,could do dolly shots kind of go left
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel4",ENTJ,with my camera go right forward and
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel5",ENTJ,backwards and I ended up pushing my
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel6",ENTJ,center of gravity too far forward I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel7",ENTJ,literally did a Superman like this
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel8",ENTJ,because I was dumb I was like oh you
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel9",ENTJ,just lean forward and that caused the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel10",ENTJ,front of the one wheel to touch the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel11",ENTJ,ground and I launched forward and I took
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel12",ENTJ,a couple running steps put my hands out
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel13",ENTJ,and I just did the asphalt
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel14",ENTJ,slip-and-slide I didn't break anything
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel15",ENTJ,and that was my number one concern the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel16",ENTJ,number one thing that people do when
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel17",ENTJ,they fall is to put an arm out they they
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel18",ENTJ,try to catch themselves so I decided to
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel19",ENTJ,just do the whole Superman asphalt
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel20",ENTJ,slip-and-slide so I did have a helmet on
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel21",ENTJ,when I crashed I just didn't have gloves
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel22",ENTJ,on so I ended up getting all my palms
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel23",ENTJ,tore up my whole arm here on the inside
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel24",ENTJ,and the outside the whole side of my
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel25",ENTJ,body here I got some cool scars here on
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel26",ENTJ,my chest I'm gonna have lost like some
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel27",ENTJ,cool story to tell to make up some that
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel28",ENTJ,actually sounds as cool as the scars
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel29",ENTJ,look I guess my knee is a little
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel30",ENTJ,compressed I've been putting cold ice on
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel31",ENTJ,it it's been fine I'm okay it's a few
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel32",ENTJ,days now everything's starting to heal
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel33",ENTJ,up
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel34",ENTJ,take good care and oh no infection
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel35",ENTJ,anything like that I'm all good you know
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel36",ENTJ,what YouTube I'm just gonna I'm just
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel37",ENTJ,gonna own it sometimes I read from
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel38",ENTJ,script so right after that happened I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel39",ENTJ,just rushed inside because I don't want
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel40",ENTJ,anyone to call an ambulance I don't have
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel41",ENTJ,to deal with any of that I don't have to
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel42",ENTJ,like reject their care and like no I'm
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel43",ENTJ,good I promise we'll just let us check
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel44",ENTJ,you and then as soon as you say okay
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel45",ENTJ,"boom 4,000 dollar medical bill like so I"
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel46",ENTJ,was I was good and all these thoughts
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel47",ENTJ,are rushing there my brain about I have
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel48",ENTJ,a lot to get done and I don't really
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel49",ENTJ,have hands right now and you don't
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel50",ENTJ,really appreciate your hands until you
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel51",ENTJ,can't even open a jar of pickles so I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel52",ENTJ,started talking about how I need to make
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel53",ENTJ,a video but I can't because I'm in pain
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel54",ENTJ,I don't feel that great and I'm
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel55",ENTJ,definitely not motivated to do it but
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel56",ENTJ,that got me thinking about motivation
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel57",ENTJ,and doing things when I don't feel like
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel58",ENTJ,it
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel59",ENTJ,even today even though I'm I'm healed
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel60",ENTJ,somewhat I guess I don't necessarily
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel61",ENTJ,feel like walking around and creating
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel62",ENTJ,this video that's what I wanted to talk
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel63",ENTJ,about today motivation and how stay
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel64",ENTJ,motivated to code or anything else you
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel65",ENTJ,want to apply these tips to I know wait
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel66",ENTJ,hold on wait don't don't click off the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel67",ENTJ,video wait wait wait wait
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel68",ENTJ,I promise there's like some actionable
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel69",ENTJ,stuff in here that you can do it's not
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel70",ENTJ,just another Tony Robbins thing or you
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel71",ENTJ,know one of those videos where you're
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel72",ENTJ,like alright I feel great I'm gonna try
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel73",ENTJ,to actually give you some things that
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel74",ENTJ,you could walk away with you're gonna be
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel75",ENTJ,a you're gonna be a big fluff and we're
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel76",ENTJ,both in focus two things in focus I can
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel77",ENTJ,barely get in focus sometimes look a
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel78",ENTJ,little buff there Josh so this is what I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel79",ENTJ,would say kind of like how motivation is
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel80",ENTJ,for all of us including me it's kind of
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel81",ENTJ,like the dichotomy of motivation we'll
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel82",ENTJ,go watch a YouTube video we'll get
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel83",ENTJ,motivated well think about all the cool
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel84",ENTJ,things we could have if we do that thing
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel85",ENTJ,that we're motivated about doing well do
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel86",ENTJ,the thing for five minutes
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel87",ENTJ,or we'll do it for a while and we'll get
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel88",ENTJ,bored and then finally we'll actively
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel89",ENTJ,avoid doing whatever it is we know we
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel90",ENTJ,should be doing or that will benefit us
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel91",ENTJ,if we do it procrastination the land of
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel92",ENTJ,tomorrow or next Monday or next month or
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel93",ENTJ,next New Year's resolution where most of
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel94",ENTJ,our potential lives I would say in the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel95",ENTJ,land of tomorrow
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel96",ENTJ,procrastination Vil so it's gone for now
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel97",ENTJ,can't even lift weights anymore goodbye
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel98",ENTJ,muscles so what we need to do is realize
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel99",ENTJ,that it's actually backwards so you do
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel100",ENTJ,the thing you get inspired while you're
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel101",ENTJ,like oh wow I actually I actually am I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel102",ENTJ,took that first step and then you get
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel103",ENTJ,motivated it's like when you go to the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel104",ENTJ,gym most of the days when I go to the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel105",ENTJ,gym I have when I have like the biggest
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel106",ENTJ,gains or the best workouts it's always
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel107",ENTJ,the times where I'm like I really don't
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel108",ENTJ,want to go and then I get there I'm like
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel109",ENTJ,you know after the warm-up or whatever
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel110",ENTJ,I'm like oh man I'm really glad I came
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel111",ENTJ,that's how it is that's how it is for
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel112",ENTJ,all of us so I get it it's backwards
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel113",ENTJ,it's unintuitive but that's just that's
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel114",ENTJ,how it works how do you get yourself to
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel115",ENTJ,take that first initial step if the key
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel116",ENTJ,to being motivated is to just do the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel117",ENTJ,thing that's easier to say Josh like so
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel118",ENTJ,I'll tell you guys how I do it there's
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel119",ENTJ,three words state story and strategy
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel120",ENTJ,those are the questions that they're not
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel121",ENTJ,just words they're actually questions so
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel122",ENTJ,what is my state how am I feeling about
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel123",ENTJ,things what is my story what am i
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel124",ENTJ,telling myself like how I'm feeling like
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel125",ENTJ,today sucks or tastes great or I'm so
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel126",ENTJ,awesome I'm so I'm so excited that I get
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel127",ENTJ,to go to this thing what is my story
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel128",ENTJ,what am I telling myself based on how I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel129",ENTJ,feel in my low energy and my high energy
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel130",ENTJ,am I pretty neutral and then what is my
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel131",ENTJ,strategy based on those two prior ones
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel132",ENTJ,is gonna determine what I actually do
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel133",ENTJ,how I actually execute so the way I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel134",ENTJ,alter my state how I'm feeling about
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel135",ENTJ,things my emotional state I get is kind
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel136",ENTJ,of a little woowoo out there just bear
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel137",ENTJ,with me here I have weird rituals we all
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel138",ENTJ,have weird rituals we all have our
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel139",ENTJ,little nervous things that we do what a
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel140",ENTJ,little nervous habits or things that we
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel141",ENTJ,do to calm ourselves down to get in the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel142",ENTJ,headspace of doing a live stream I'll go
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel143",ENTJ,outside in my backyard and I'll play
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel144",ENTJ,with my dogs for like 10 or 15 minutes
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel145",ENTJ,it's a good way to up the energy I'll do
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel146",ENTJ,some push-ups and it's great for
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel147",ENTJ,engagement I'm already
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel148",ENTJ,you know and engage with my dogs having
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel149",ENTJ,fun just kind of if I want to get into
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel150",ENTJ,like focused and study mode so this
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel151",ENTJ,would be like for code I turn on a movie
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel152",ENTJ,soundtrack I'm a big movie soundtrack
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel153",ENTJ,buff I loved Hans Zimmer specially man
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel154",ENTJ,his stuff is so good have you ever
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel155",ENTJ,turned like I mean it makes anything
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel156",ENTJ,epic like you could just be like
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel157",ENTJ,shredding paper you just put on like
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel158",ENTJ,Hans Zimmer background and now you're
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel159",ENTJ,its most epic paper shred of your life
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel160",ENTJ,anyways I I do meditate I don't talk
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel161",ENTJ,about it that much because again people
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel162",ENTJ,start to think you're like oh you're
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel163",ENTJ,into that stuff like because I'm like
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel164",ENTJ,that too right I just do it to slow down
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel165",ENTJ,kind of just take a pulse on everything
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel166",ENTJ,up here like how am i how am i doing I'm
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel167",ENTJ,my feeling is there any perpetual
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel168",ENTJ,repeating kind of thoughts that I need
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel169",ENTJ,to pinpoint and be like alright address
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel170",ENTJ,it do a little body scan you know just
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel171",ENTJ,like have you ever tried to feel your
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel172",ENTJ,hair I know it sounds really 4:20 but
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel173",ENTJ,like takes a second and it requires a
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel174",ENTJ,lot of awareness and that will kind of
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel175",ENTJ,like slow you down and do that for the
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel176",ENTJ,rest of your body for the gym I set out
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel177",ENTJ,my supplements on the counter I take
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel178",ENTJ,them in the order that I put them out
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel179",ENTJ,every single day same order
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel180",ENTJ,same supplements and then I go and I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel181",ENTJ,listen to an audiobook and then I get in
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel182",ENTJ,my car and I roll down my windows and I
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel183",ENTJ,sit there for a few seconds and it's
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel184",ENTJ,just like a ritual that's what I do to
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel185",ENTJ,go to the gym and that kind of hypes me
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel186",ENTJ,up and gets me prepared you're more
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel187",ENTJ,likely to get started with something if
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel188",ENTJ,you have like a pleasant ritual to get
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel189",ENTJ,it done actually the dopamine receptors
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel190",ENTJ,in your brain fire before you actually
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel191",ENTJ,get the reward I know that's really
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel192",ENTJ,weird but the dopamine receptors in your
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel193",ENTJ,brain actually start going off when
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel194",ENTJ,you're about to get the reward and when
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel195",ENTJ,you get it it's nowhere near the kind of
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel196",ENTJ,activity as like right before so if
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel197",ENTJ,there's something difficult that I need
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel198",ENTJ,to do I'm not a fan of or that I just
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel199",ENTJ,know I have to take care of I set up a
"ENTJ_Coding when you don't ""feel"" like it #grindreel200",ENTJ,little routine that angles it in a

ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)19,ENTP,wanted to talk about why and what's been

ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)25,ENTP,outlet I want to be able to talk about
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)26,ENTP,stuff okay so this is one of those
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)27,ENTP,videos it's just like oh I left my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)28,ENTP,software engineering job and I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)29,ENTP,completely understand how much of a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)30,ENTP,place of privilege that I come from to
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)31,ENTP,be able to leave a job like that and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)32,ENTP,also have the option to do all the
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)33,ENTP,things that I've been doing basically so
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)34,ENTP,I completely understand and I know that
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)35,ENTP,I am so fortunate to be in this position
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)36,ENTP,so let me start off saying that just
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)37,ENTP,wanted to put that out there
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)38,ENTP,so I go to therapy I have been going to
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)39,ENTP,therapy for I think about two years now
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)40,ENTP,and I first started going because I had
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)41,ENTP,anxiety and panic attacks and stuff and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)42,ENTP,I was so sick of feeling so anxious all
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)43,ENTP,the time so that's what started it since
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)44,ENTP,then I have gotten over a lot of my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)45,ENTP,anxiety and panic attacks stuff thank
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)46,ENTP,God and I started going just to kind of
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)47,ENTP,talk to someone about my feelings and my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)48,ENTP,thoughts which has been the most useful
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)49,ENTP,thing so my current therapist I started
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)50,ENTP,going to her because I was like hey I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)51,ENTP,think that the thing that is missing
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)52,ENTP,from my life right now that is not
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)53,ENTP,allowing me to reach my goals is
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)54,ENTP,discipline it's funny because through a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)55,ENTP,lot of sessions and stuff I realized I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)56,ENTP,was like so wrong and thinking about
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)57,ENTP,that I mean I think I do like lack
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)58,ENTP,discipline in some things obviously but
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)59,ENTP,that was not the true thing that I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)60,ENTP,needed to think about and work on so one
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)61,ENTP,of the exercises that my therapist gave
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)62,ENTP,me is to draw out literally visualize
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)63,ENTP,what kind of life do I want to live in
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)64,ENTP,the future so talking about it with my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)65,ENTP,therapist and kind of thinking about
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)66,ENTP,what I drew that day it made me really
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)67,ENTP,reflect on what do I want in life
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)68,ENTP,and how am I going to get there I really
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)69,ENTP,like being able to spend an hour or not
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)70,ENTP,thinking about the time and drinking a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)71,ENTP,cup of tea and really enjoying how good
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)72,ENTP,like milk teas or just like sitting down
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)73,ENTP,and listening to music or just
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)74,ENTP,appreciating my dogs company like these
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)75,ENTP,are all things that I really like to do
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)76,ENTP,I'm an over-thinker
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)77,ENTP,I'm also an over feeler and so I really
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)78,ENTP,enjoy the time that I get to kind of
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)79,ENTP,just put life on pause and basically
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)80,ENTP,process everything which I know I've
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)81,ENTP,talked about in a lot of videos but
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)82,ENTP,really that's really important to me
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)83,ENTP,among other things I really like being
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)84,ENTP,able to be productive and feel like I'm
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)85,ENTP,useful and kick ass at something like
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)86,ENTP,those those are also feelings that I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)87,ENTP,really like chasing too and in order to
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)88,ENTP,do all of those things and live the life
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)89,ENTP,that I want I really need to be good at
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)90,ENTP,managing my intake of the world and also
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)91,ENTP,my out take my output of the world as
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)92,ENTP,well because if I input too much then I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)93,ENTP,literally have so much to process and if
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)94,ENTP,I output too much I'm literally just too
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)95,ENTP,exhausted to even input anything into my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)96,ENTP,brain anyway this is really abstract and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)97,ENTP,I'm sure if this it's like none of this
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)98,ENTP,makes sense but it did really make me
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)99,ENTP,reflect on you know what do I want what
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)100,ENTP,kind of life do I want to live and when
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)101,ENTP,I compares what I wanted in life to the
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)102,ENTP,life that I was actually living it was a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)103,ENTP,lot of input and a lot of output and not
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)104,ENTP,enough time to process anything I was
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)105,ENTP,trying to make every single minute of my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)106,ENTP,life super productive and worthy and I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)107,ENTP,wasn't wasting any time and that's like
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)108,ENTP,the complete opposite of what kind of I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)109,ENTP,wanted to do which makes sense right
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)110,ENTP,like most people are like hey let's
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)111,ENTP,figure out how to be the most productive
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)112,ENTP,person you can be let's make sure that
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)113,ENTP,you are quantifying your stuff against
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)114,ENTP,your goals like that's totally fine like
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)115,ENTP,that works for some people and great
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)116,ENTP,like you found the system that works for
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)117,ENTP,you I think I had tried that and I did
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)118,ENTP,oh I did a lot of that like mental
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)119,ENTP,calculation and it was honestly just
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)120,ENTP,really exhausting for me and so I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)121,ENTP,realized like tangibly the things that I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)122,ENTP,needed in life was a lot more
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)123,ENTP,flexibility in terms of flexibility in
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)124,ENTP,the time that I had or flexibility to
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)125,ENTP,feel things in the moment or flexibility
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)126,ENTP,to I don't know kind of make decisions
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)127,ENTP,on my own that best suited my needs I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)128,ENTP,really just really just needed to slow
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)129,ENTP,down like a lot so how this all ties
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)130,ENTP,back into like why I left patreon is cuz
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)131,ENTP,I feel like I hit a breaking point where
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)132,ENTP,I realized that working there wasn't
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)133,ENTP,going to give me the time and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)134,ENTP,flexibility and the kind of life that I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)135,ENTP,really wanted it took me a long time to
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)136,ENTP,figure that out because patreon was my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)137,ENTP,dream job like I loved working there
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)138,ENTP,like that still doesn't change even
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)139,ENTP,after I have moved on but the things
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)140,ENTP,that I really liked about the job and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)141,ENTP,the actual execution of like what it is
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)142,ENTP,to work at that job were two different
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)143,ENTP,things
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)144,ENTP,and I was constantly managing my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)145,ENTP,relationship with work at this point
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)146,ENTP,I spent like three hours a day commuting
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)147,ENTP,to and from my work which I did the math
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)148,ENTP,I have spent three months in total
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)149,ENTP,commuting to and from patreon during my
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)150,ENTP,time there which like that's so much
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)151,ENTP,time I mean I was really sad to leave
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)152,ENTP,that job though cuz it was my dream job
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)153,ENTP,like I said I really still personally
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)154,ENTP,aligned with the mission that they're
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)155,ENTP,going after and I am and was still so
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)156,ENTP,passionate about being a part of that
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)157,ENTP,and wanting to do good in the world by
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)158,ENTP,creators and their fans I mean I was
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)159,ENTP,able to realize kind of like this
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)160,ENTP,lifelong goal that I had of starting a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)161,ENTP,YouTube channel while at patreon because
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)162,ENTP,I was surrounded by so many great
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)163,ENTP,creative people and really motivated and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)164,ENTP,awesome passionate people who were
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)165,ENTP,really interested in the arts and I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)166,ENTP,learned so much as a software engineer
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)167,ENTP,and as a person I got to me and work
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)168,ENTP,with so many incredible individuals
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)169,ENTP,there that I totally would have been
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)170,ENTP,like a completely different person and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)171,ENTP,had I not worked there so I am so truly
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)172,ENTP,grateful for the time that I had there
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)173,ENTP,which was two and a half years and yeah
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)174,ENTP,it was so hard leaving honestly like I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)175,ENTP,it felt like a breakup I'm still a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)176,ENTP,little bit sad to be honest and as tough
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)177,ENTP,as it was I am so glad to work there and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)178,ENTP,I think it was the right decision for me
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)179,ENTP,to leave so after I left I took six
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)180,ENTP,weeks off which I am so lucky and glad
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)181,ENTP,that I did because I took six weeks just
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)182,ENTP,to kind of decompress between jobs and
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)183,ENTP,it was nice I felt like I was on like
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)184,ENTP,summer vacation again and I really got a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)185,ENTP,lot of time to myself
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)186,ENTP,which was kind of making up for lost
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)187,ENTP,time honestly you know I was like
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)188,ENTP,commuting so freaking much I didn't
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)189,ENTP,really do like a whole lot during my six
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)190,ENTP,weeks I honestly just hung out and like
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)191,ENTP,decompressed did like chores and stuff
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)192,ENTP,that I had been wanting to do for a
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)193,ENTP,while like this whole dining room behind
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)194,ENTP,me I did turn my six weeks off because I
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)195,ENTP,just wanted to make my home feel more
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)196,ENTP,comfy and cozy
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)197,ENTP,me and I slept a lot and I can't and it
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)198,ENTP,was such a good time and during this
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)199,ENTP,time I didn't make any videos because
ENTP_I left my job (and where I've been)200,ENTP,one of the things that I think was kind
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions0,ENFJ,I'm playing some background music so
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions1,ENFJ,that you get entertained why I talk
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions2,ENFJ,except I think that I'll be a little
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions3,ENFJ,distracted okay so today I wanted to so
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions4,ENFJ,the other day I by the way made my plant
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions5,ENFJ,Bebo if anyone knows that reference well
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions6,ENFJ,good for you
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions7,ENFJ,but yeah so today I wanted to talk about
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions8,ENFJ,being an INTP and dealing with emotions
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions9,ENFJ,the other day I was on reddit and I kind
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions10,ENFJ,of put this post I was talking about how
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions11,ENFJ,I have troubles with my emotions
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions12,ENFJ,basically it was the gist of it and I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions13,ENFJ,bought a lot of pop votes and people
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions14,ENFJ,were like well I really I was like you
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions15,ENFJ,know what let's make a video about it if
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions16,ENFJ,people kind of understand then you know
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions17,ENFJ,why not so that's what I'm doing if you
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions18,ENFJ,couldn't tell and that very necessary
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions19,ENFJ,beginning was not necessary hence making
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions20,ENFJ,it unnecessary wow I'm so smart but so
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions21,ENFJ,today I wanted to talk about emotions
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions22,ENFJ,and how it is a weird situation for me
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions23,ENFJ,I've been thinking about like this for a
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions24,ENFJ,while now but I was like is it too
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions25,ENFJ,insane that I think this way I mean I'm
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions26,ENFJ,obviously not gonna 100% contributed to
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions27,ENFJ,being an entp but I I mean since other
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions28,ENFJ,entp is related to it I guess it must
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions29,ENFJ,have some truth
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions30,ENFJ,truths to it yeah so it was basically
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions31,ENFJ,just that I don't really understand
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions32,ENFJ,emotions like I don't understand
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions33,ENFJ,happiness and I I experienced it but I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions34,ENFJ,don't understand it I have the hardest
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions35,ENFJ,time really interpreting what emotions
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions36,ENFJ,mean you know so many times I'm angry or
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions37,ENFJ,I'm upset I usually don't know why it is
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions38,ENFJ,the case I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions39,ENFJ,and that's all I do know so I I tend to
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions40,ENFJ,like eliminate the entire process of you
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions41,ENFJ,know check what what's right and what's
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions42,ENFJ,wrong like I don't know a song okay I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions43,ENFJ,heard it once before anyway I'm kind of
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions44,ENFJ,distracted okay they're real so much
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions45,ENFJ,better I can focus now on what I'm
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions46,ENFJ,saying okay so it was basically just
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions47,ENFJ,that I experienced the emotions but I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions48,ENFJ,can't really express them and I don't
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions49,ENFJ,understand that I was talking about this
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions50,ENFJ,to another friend of mine who I think is
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions51,ENFJ,an ENFJ or Ian TJ I think and I was
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions52,ENFJ,trying to him by this and well then he
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions53,ENFJ,asked me to join his cult which is
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions54,ENFJ,basically where you know parts of your
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions55,ENFJ,brain but it was a joke yeah so I just
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions56,ENFJ,don't know how to interpret emotions I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions57,ENFJ,mean I don't want to sound like typical
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions58,ENFJ,oh my god look at me I am a thinker and
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions59,ENFJ,I don't know how to understand emotions
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions60,ENFJ,you know feelers go away like that's not
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions61,ENFJ,that's not what it is because I I mean I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions62,ENFJ,don't know I feel like there's a stigma
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions63,ENFJ,on thinkers and feelers I can totally
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions64,ENFJ,see why but it's just not that I'm
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions65,ENFJ,saying that it's accurate but I can see
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions66,ENFJ,why the stigmas surrounds that but I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions67,ENFJ,guess my basic concern is that like I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions68,ENFJ,don't know how to interpret what I'm
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions69,ENFJ,feeling so I'm thinking about the this
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions70,ENFJ,the other day and I don't know what I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions71,ENFJ,was feeling but I was like hmm I don't
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions72,ENFJ,understand why this exists you know I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions73,ENFJ,don't understand why it is that certain
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions74,ENFJ,I certainly like things happen in your
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions75,ENFJ,life and they automatically either well
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions76,ENFJ,I don't know how sadness works but I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions77,ENFJ,guess it's like really are less release
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions78,ENFJ,of serotonin or more you know or like
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions79,ENFJ,something's happening
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions80,ENFJ,you're like well my brain decides to
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions81,ENFJ,automatically release more dopamine or
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions82,ENFJ,serotonin whatever it is you know it's
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions83,ENFJ,just I find the concept very weird
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions84,ENFJ,because it's like how does your brain
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions85,ENFJ,even know how to release what when all
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions86,ENFJ,the way experiencing it but like I guess
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions87,ENFJ,if we further continues conversations
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions88,ENFJ,gonna go on margin existential ish maybe
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions89,ENFJ,situation but it's basically just like I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions90,ENFJ,don't understand how I'm supposed to
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions91,ENFJ,into breath what I feel you know like
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions92,ENFJ,like you should most of the time I'm
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions93,ENFJ,just confused and like I know that I'll
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions94,ENFJ,be feeling down but I I can't I can't
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions95,ENFJ,pinpoint why is it is that I would be
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions96,ENFJ,feeling now or sad or depressed like I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions97,ENFJ,think a few months ago I had this like
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions98,ENFJ,depressive phase I thought I was
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions99,ENFJ,depressed but I well I disagree now I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions100,ENFJ,don't think I was it was just it was a
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions101,ENFJ,very intense space but yeah it's just
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions102,ENFJ,like I don't understand and and that's
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions103,ENFJ,why I don't know again I don't know if
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions104,ENFJ,this is an intp thing or it's just like
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions105,ENFJ,my thing I I just can't interpret the
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions106,ENFJ,fact that the things that I'm feeling
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions107,ENFJ,and I'm supposed to process them for
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions108,ENFJ,some reason so I just I completely
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions109,ENFJ,eliminate that part it's like I I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions110,ENFJ,usually like even the so many times the
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions111,ENFJ,you know people will ask me you know
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions112,ENFJ,this does this happen what's your
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions113,ENFJ,opinion on it and I'd be like well I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions114,ENFJ,don't know and it's so difficult for me
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions115,ENFJ,to come to conclusions
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions116,ENFJ,because it's I look at everything from
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions117,ENFJ,every angle so even if someone does
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions118,ENFJ,something awful i i will obviously look
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions119,ENFJ,at the victim side but at the same time
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions120,ENFJ,i also look at the the criminals
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions121,ENFJ,perspective so i guess it just it comes
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions122,ENFJ,down to really how do i
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions123,ENFJ,feel about something I don't know
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions124,ENFJ,do I have opinions about things yes I do
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions125,ENFJ,but they're mostly not based on what I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions126,ENFJ,feel they're more based on like what I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions127,ENFJ,guess what's more I don't know I guess
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions128,ENFJ,again my opinions also aren't that
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions129,ENFJ,strong so in their very momentary
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions130,ENFJ,because the people I I keep switching to
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions131,ENFJ,many things like for instance I was
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions132,ENFJ,giving this example so the beginning of
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions133,ENFJ,this year I was religious um but then
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions134,ENFJ,right now I am an atheist and I'm sure
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions135,ENFJ,that that will change because I'm
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions136,ENFJ,exploring everything but it's it's so
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions137,ENFJ,hard for me to come to a conclusion and
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions138,ENFJ,it's just and I usually never know how I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions139,ENFJ,feel about things I know how I you know
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions140,ENFJ,think about things like I don't know if
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions141,ENFJ,that sounds weird but it's just it's
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions142,ENFJ,such a weird concept you know it's so
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions143,ENFJ,it's I don't even know how to explain it
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions144,ENFJ,it's that's how abstract I feel that it
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions145,ENFJ,is because it's so difficult to explain
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions146,ENFJ,this because it's like what really it is
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions147,ENFJ,it yeah I personally myself don't really
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions148,ENFJ,understand
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions149,ENFJ,hence the entire video con um but yeah I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions150,ENFJ,just I don't get it
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions151,ENFJ,this video is literally just eight
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions152,ENFJ,minutes of me saying I don't get it you
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions153,ENFJ,know I guess that's like an issue and I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions154,ENFJ,think that's like an entp shoot I saw
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions155,ENFJ,like again I posted on reddit and I was
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions156,ENFJ,like what do I you know how do I do
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions157,ENFJ,something about this and they're like
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions158,ENFJ,well I don't know well you know they
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions159,ENFJ,usually talk about why it is like make
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions160,ENFJ,like a mental checklist or like the
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions161,ENFJ,commenters who comment
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions162,ENFJ,my post there they basically told me to
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions163,ENFJ,checklist in my head mentally what
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions164,ENFJ,happened and why is it that I felt the
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions165,ENFJ,way that I found which I mean you know
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions166,ENFJ,it's it's very logical and it should be
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions167,ENFJ,easy to do but it really isn't because I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions168,ENFJ,was trying it the other day and and it
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions169,ENFJ,just I just find it so absurd but also
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions170,ENFJ,so fascinating that we experienced
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions171,ENFJ,things and then these experiences like
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions172,ENFJ,affect us
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions173,ENFJ,you know I for some reason that's like a
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions174,ENFJ,very fascinating concept to me that's
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions175,ENFJ,all I have to say about this peebo and I
ENFJ_ENTP and emotions176,ENFJ,will see you the next video if you would

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍87,ENTP,each other is basically backstage
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍88,ENTP,because there aren't cameras rolling and
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍89,ENTP,also because once you're in the

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍126,ENTP,confidence on whatever sports they're
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍127,ENTP,doing but I would say that for the
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍128,ENTP,rookies it is a real competition because
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍129,ENTP,it is a time for screen time and
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍130,ENTP,basically it's really hard to get screen
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍131,ENTP,time and if you're gonna be getting

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍142,ENTP,I would say that this is also half in
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍143,ENTP,half because in the beginning I SEC was
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍144,ENTP,really really really popular I feel like
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍145,ENTP,it was super popular like when it first

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍150,ENTP,goes by it did kind of lose its
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍151,ENTP,popularity but a lot of people still
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍152,ENTP,watching a lot of fans don't really
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍153,ENTP,watch it so I would say that it does
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍154,ENTP,impact the group's career but not as big
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍155,ENTP,as it did long time ago long time ago if
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍156,ENTP,one member did really good in a sport
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍157,ENTP,then all the other variety shows they
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍158,ENTP,would call that member because that's
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍159,ENTP,the only reference that they had but
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍160,ENTP,nowadays there's so many references that
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍161,ENTP,you can
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍162,ENTP,like through SNS or you know reality TV
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍163,ENTP,show so it's really different can you

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍166,ENTP,me because I wasn't really like
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍167,ENTP,concentrated to see oh my god

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍172,ENTP,crazy environment that you don't really

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍183,ENTP,that wasn't something that I was very
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍184,ENTP,like interested in so I didn't look at
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍185,ENTP,that so then the question that I got is
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍186,ENTP,hi Christine there are a lot of rumors
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍187,ENTP,that if you reject MBC's invitation for

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍189,ENTP,shows over not invite you as much is
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍190,ENTP,that really true I wouldn't necessarily

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍192,ENTP,like ban you from variety shows but they

ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍194,ENTP,have to say that this usually goes for
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍195,ENTP,when the group gets popular over time so
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍196,ENTP,for example let's to say that there was
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍197,ENTP,a rookie group in like the beginning
ENTP_The real secrets of the IDOL STAR ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS | IDOL INSIDER 🔍198,ENTP,stages and they weren't that popular

ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube0,ESFJc,hey long time they see I'm really
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube1,ESFJc,excited to be back but I feel like
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube2,ESFJc,there's something I need to address much
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube3,ESFJc,better also I quit my job all right so
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube4,ESFJc,this video is gonna be a little bit
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube5,ESFJc,different or it's gonna be what you've
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube6,ESFJc,been expecting the whole time I don't
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube7,ESFJc,know I'm not a mind reader
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube8,ESFJc,anyway the title isn't clickbait I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube9,ESFJc,really did quit my job for those who had
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube10,ESFJc,no idea I spent the last 6 or so years
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube11,ESFJc,as a software engineer and then an
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube12,ESFJc,engineering manager in the tech industry
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube13,ESFJc,in San Francisco and I've worked at a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube14,ESFJc,couple of companies but for the past two
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube15,ESFJc,and a half years I've been working at
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube16,ESFJc,this like little startup that then
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube17,ESFJc,became a bigger startup called patreon
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube18,ESFJc,it's basically a membership platform
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube19,ESFJc,that makes it really easy for creators
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube20,ESFJc,to get paid thanks jack this past Friday
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube21,ESFJc,was actually my last day at patreon all
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube22,ESFJc,right al unemployed and I left to do
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube23,ESFJc,this you know have my videos demonetized
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube24,ESFJc,for a living I originally planned to
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube25,ESFJc,have this video be this like big
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube26,ESFJc,production with a bunch of fancy editing
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube27,ESFJc,tricks and stuff but I didn't feel like
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube28,ESFJc,it so I didn't I've also already made a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube29,ESFJc,couple of involved videos about leaving
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube30,ESFJc,engineering and becoming a manager and
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube31,ESFJc,joining patreon I'll leave those videos
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube32,ESFJc,in the cards here and like the
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube33,ESFJc,description down here as for my decision
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube34,ESFJc,to leave the industry as a whole it's
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube35,ESFJc,weird because for me it always felt like
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube36,ESFJc,super scary and risky but all of my
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube37,ESFJc,friends and basically everybody I know
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube38,ESFJc,has been super supportive ever since I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube39,ESFJc,posted my first video so what's my
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube40,ESFJc,problem making things for a living has
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube41,ESFJc,basically been a dream of mine ever
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube42,ESFJc,since I was a kid so what's the holdup
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube43,ESFJc,like why was it so hard for me to take
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube44,ESFJc,that leap especially considering it had
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube45,ESFJc,become financially possible to do so
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube46,ESFJc,like with the growth of the channel and
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube47,ESFJc,the fact that I spent the last year
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube48,ESFJc,burning myself out trying to do two jobs
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube49,ESFJc,well the short answer is that I'm a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube50,ESFJc,little baby and I'm scared this is my
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube51,ESFJc,mom she wasn't my birth mom but she
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube52,ESFJc,raised me from birth you know her name
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube53,ESFJc,was Sharon and she was like my biggest
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube54,ESFJc,fan
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube55,ESFJc,even back before I had really done
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube56,ESFJc,anything she made me feel like I could
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube57,ESFJc,do anything in the world you know like
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube58,ESFJc,moms in like she was my everything she
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube59,ESFJc,was so supportive of me in everything
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube60,ESFJc,that I did like one of my first big
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube61,ESFJc,interests was drawing I used to sit for
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube62,ESFJc,hours when I was a kid and draw like my
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube63,ESFJc,favorite cartoon characters uh-huh I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube64,ESFJc,still got it
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube65,ESFJc,still can draw a little Goku she would
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube66,ESFJc,always you know put my drawings on the
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube67,ESFJc,fridge or into a photo album or
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube68,ESFJc,something that was really encouraging
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube69,ESFJc,that was my first introduction to doing
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube70,ESFJc,like anything created I also had a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube71,ESFJc,typewriter that I got from a thrift
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube72,ESFJc,store and I would use it to type up
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube73,ESFJc,scripts of like fake Dragon Ball
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube74,ESFJc,inspired story is essentially fan
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube75,ESFJc,fiction and actor them out with my
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube76,ESFJc,friends on the street now that I said
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube77,ESFJc,that out loud I think I was LARPing but
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube78,ESFJc,yeah that's basically the reason I still
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube79,ESFJc,reptile to this day it's like I thought
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube80,ESFJc,in this frame alone there's a bunch of
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube81,ESFJc,Goku's she'd also take me to like yugioh
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube82,ESFJc,tournaments across town where as a 10
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube83,ESFJc,year old I would consistently get
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube84,ESFJc,trashed by college students but you know
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube85,ESFJc,she still took me every weekend she can
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube86,ESFJc,even drive me herself because she had
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube87,ESFJc,cerebral palsy cerebral palsy cerebral
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube88,ESFJc,palsy cerebral palsy palsy cerebral
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube89,ESFJc,palsy she couldn't even drive me herself
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube90,ESFJc,because she had cerebral palsy which I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube91,ESFJc,could barely even say let alone imagine
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube92,ESFJc,living life with but she always found a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube93,ESFJc,way to make it work this is me and my
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube94,ESFJc,mom when I was in fifth grade on the day
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube95,ESFJc,that I was given a citizen of the Year
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube96,ESFJc,award from my City which I can only
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube97,ESFJc,assume as a consolation for not being
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube98,ESFJc,cool in elementary school and then a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube99,ESFJc,little over a week after this photo was
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube100,ESFJc,taken
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube101,ESFJc,my mom was taken from me she passed away
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube102,ESFJc,due to complications from a stroke I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube103,ESFJc,wasn't even home when it happened I I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube104,ESFJc,was staying at a friend's place
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube105,ESFJc,and iíve kind of always wondered if
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube106,ESFJc,things would be different if I had been
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube107,ESFJc,there you know I would replay events in
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube108,ESFJc,my head and I always felt really guilty
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube109,ESFJc,that I didn't appreciate her as much as
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube110,ESFJc,she deserved mostly because I was just
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube111,ESFJc,like a punk kid like the last thing that
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube112,ESFJc,we disagreed about is so dumb she would
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube113,ESFJc,ask me to clean my room this is a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube114,ESFJc,reasonable thing and I would always just
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube115,ESFJc,be like in a minute because I was a
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube116,ESFJc,chronic procrastinator and I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube117,ESFJc,I also had undiagnosed ADHD at the time
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube118,ESFJc,but she loved me all the same this loss
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube119,ESFJc,like really stayed with me I essentially
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube120,ESFJc,developed a fear that like in an instant
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube121,ESFJc,my whole world could come crumbling down
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube122,ESFJc,and losing the person that I was closest
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube123,ESFJc,to I felt really alone and I also think
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube124,ESFJc,it made me really averse to risk because
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube125,ESFJc,I wanted to make decisions that reduced
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube126,ESFJc,the chances that I would experience that
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube127,ESFJc,kind of loss again that was when I was
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube128,ESFJc,12 and the next six years were some of
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube129,ESFJc,the darkest in my life but I left my
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube130,ESFJc,hometown when I was 18 to go to Georgia
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube131,ESFJc,Tech and I basically never looked back
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube132,ESFJc,for college I actually got a scholarship
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube133,ESFJc,to help me afford out-of-state tuition
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube134,ESFJc,because I didn't have any money and I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube135,ESFJc,was like my family couldn't really help
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube136,ESFJc,me out financially but I still graduated
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube137,ESFJc,"with about $40,000 in student loan debt"
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube138,ESFJc,which it probably could have been less
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube139,ESFJc,if I knew anything about managing money
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube140,ESFJc,but I was 18 and there wasn't anybody
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube141,ESFJc,telling me how to do things College was

ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube147,ESFJc,community and helping me feel less alone
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube148,ESFJc,it was also super difficult because I
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube149,ESFJc,was really afraid of being stuck with
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube150,ESFJc,debt and not being able to get a job out
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube151,ESFJc,of college so I took my life like full

ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube153,ESFJc,computer science degree and like the
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube154,ESFJc,first two years of college I don't

ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube156,ESFJc,internship at Google which granted me

ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube170,ESFJc,now but it really helped with the whole
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube171,ESFJc,career thing especially considering that

ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube180,ESFJc,live lives that don't deviate too much
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube181,ESFJc,out of the norm out of fear of being
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube182,ESFJc,judged I would assume at least that was
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube183,ESFJc,the case for me a lot of people asked me
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube184,ESFJc,if they should major in in computer
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube185,ESFJc,science and I can't stress enough how
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube186,ESFJc,much of a coin flip it was for me and
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube187,ESFJc,the fact that what I studied was
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube188,ESFJc,valuable to the market like there's so
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube189,ESFJc,many times that I got lucky in this

ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube192,ESFJc,psychology but I basically just like
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube193,ESFJc,flipped a coin through college I was
ESFJc_i quit software engineering to do youtube194,ESFJc,basically keeping any creative

ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer0,ESFP,hey my name's Matt and I make realistic
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer1,ESFP,career videos and today we're gonna talk
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer2,ESFP,about why only 1 out of 10 people who
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer3,ESFP,graduate with a mechanical engineering
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer4,ESFP,degree will ever work as a mechanical
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer5,ESFP,engineer when I started my channel seven
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer6,ESFP,years ago I was really Pro engineering
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer7,ESFP,and so I made a lot of videos that
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer8,ESFP,talked about engineering as a career and
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer9,ESFP,at the time I was interning at SoCal gas
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer10,ESFP,at a very high-paying internship and I
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer11,ESFP,thought oh after I get a full-time job
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer12,ESFP,it's gonna become really interesting but
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer13,ESFP,my internship was really boring but what
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer14,ESFP,I discovered was all my engineering jobs
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer15,ESFP,were boring and so I started making a
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer16,ESFP,lot of videos talking about how boring
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer17,ESFP,my jobs are but also how hard it is to
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer18,ESFP,get a job as a mechanical engineer so a
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer19,ESFP,couple years ago I turned anti
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer20,ESFP,engineering I pivoted my channel
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer21,ESFP,basically and a lot of people got mad at
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer22,ESFP,me
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer23,ESFP,I got a ton I got ton of personal
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer24,ESFP,insults you know people call him dumb
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer25,ESFP,people calling me lazy people call me at
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer26,ESFP,entitled millennial and it's funny
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer27,ESFP,because out of all these people throwing
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer28,ESFP,insults to meet you when I'm just gonna
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer29,ESFP,I'm actually gonna reveal some data in
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer30,ESFP,this video but mostly people throwing
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer31,ESFP,insults to me they're studying
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer32,ESFP,engineering and they will never work as
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer33,ESFP,an engineer and that's because there are
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer34,ESFP,thirty thousand people graduating with a
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer35,ESFP,mechanical engineering degree and only
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer36,ESFP,"2,500 mechanical engineering jobs"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer37,ESFP,opening up now let me distinguish
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer38,ESFP,technology jobs and engineering jobs
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer39,ESFP,technology jobs are things like software
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer40,ESFP,development software engineering web
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer41,ESFP,development data signs VR I encourage
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer42,ESFP,people to go into technology I
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer43,ESFP,discourage people from going into
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer44,ESFP,engineering mechanical aerospace
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer45,ESFP,chemical civil the physical types of
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer46,ESFP,engineering and so when you look at the
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer47,ESFP,data for every job opening there are ten
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer48,ESFP,mechanical engineering grads so what do
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer49,ESFP,you think are going to happen there's
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer50,ESFP,this not enough jobs available for the
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer51,ESFP,"30,000 people graduating each year with"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer52,ESFP,a mechanical engineering degree now
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer53,ESFP,whenever I present data like this which
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer54,ESFP,I talked about it even a couple years
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer55,ESFP,ago people get so mad at me and they
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer56,ESFP,throw a ton of personal insults
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer57,ESFP,but ask yourself are you really being an
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer58,ESFP,engineer if you can't just look at the
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer59,ESFP,data and do some basic analysis like
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer60,ESFP,"okay 30,000 here who graduate degrees"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer61,ESFP,"and then 2,500 job openings if you're"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer62,ESFP,gonna be engineer you got to be logical
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer63,ESFP,efficient and unbiased to the data and
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer64,ESFP,that's just the data so you can throw
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer65,ESFP,all the personal insults you want toward
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer66,ESFP,me but that still doesn't change the
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer67,ESFP,data and honestly saying one out of ten
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer68,ESFP,mechanical engineering grads will ever
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer69,ESFP,get a job as a mechanical engineer is
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer70,ESFP,being generous because if you think
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer71,ESFP,"about it in 2017 there's 30,000 people"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer72,ESFP,that graduated with a mechanical
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer73,ESFP,engineer you will say 5000 of them got
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer74,ESFP,"jobs welcomes 2018 those 25,000 still"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer75,ESFP,need a job and there's an additional
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer76,ESFP,"30,000 people in 2018 are already"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer77,ESFP,graduated with a mechanical engineering
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer78,ESFP,"degree so that makes 55,000 people"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer79,ESFP,"competing for 2,000 3,000 or 4,000"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer80,ESFP,mechanical engineering job openings
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer81,ESFP,people love to stroke their own egos
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer82,ESFP,whenever they have an opportunity so
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer83,ESFP,whenever I say things like this I get
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer84,ESFP,people without writing my comments on
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer85,ESFP,youtube or on my Instagram that they'll
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer86,ESFP,say something like this well I graduated
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer87,ESFP,from Georgia Tech summa wad and my
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer88,ESFP,first job was at land rover they're
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer89,ESFP,paying me a hundred thousand and if you
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer90,ESFP,can't do the same you're lazy and and
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer91,ESFP,dumb that's exactly how I read your
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer92,ESFP,comments when when you write something
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer93,ESFP,like that so to the people that say
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer94,ESFP,things like that I have two things to
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer95,ESFP,say to you number one you're a jackass
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer96,ESFP,and nobody likes you number two you're
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer97,ESFP,still at a middle-class job going to an
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer98,ESFP,office Monday through Friday and getting
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer99,ESFP,paid less 30% less than a comparable
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer100,ESFP,software developer so you're successful
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer101,ESFP,but you're not that successful also
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer102,ESFP,whenever I met comedic like this I'm
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer103,ESFP,gonna get a flood of comments emails and
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer104,ESFP,messages essentially saying well Matt
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer105,ESFP,what do I do I'm in my third year fourth
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer106,ESFP,year of mechanical engineering and I
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer107,ESFP,can't switch out now and I'm several
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer108,ESFP,thousand dollars in debt what do I do
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer109,ESFP,so the first thing I'm gonna say is
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer110,ESFP,something that's gonna sting and then
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer111,ESFP,the second thing I will say is something
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer112,ESFP,that's helpful
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer113,ESFP,so first is that you could easily
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer114,ESFP,look this up before you study mechanical
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer115,ESFP,engineering it took me 15 minutes to
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer116,ESFP,find this information and also I've been
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer117,ESFP,making videos that are anti engineering
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer118,ESFP,for several years now and you didn't
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer119,ESFP,want to take my advice before so you put
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer120,ESFP,yourself in that situation
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer121,ESFP,and also that's one of the reason why
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer122,ESFP,I'm so passionate about making these
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer123,ESFP,kind of videos is because it saves
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer124,ESFP,people thousands of dollars and years or
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer125,ESFP,their life second thing I'll say is
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer126,ESFP,something helpful you can finish your
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer127,ESFP,mechanical engineering degree and see if
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer128,ESFP,you can get a job that you like because
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer129,ESFP,even though I'm very anti engineering
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer130,ESFP,there are several engineers out there
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer131,ESFP,who like their job but if you can't get
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer132,ESFP,a job
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer133,ESFP,switch to technology do something like
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer134,ESFP,web development data science because
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer135,ESFP,honestly it doesn't take four years of
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer136,ESFP,"your life and $50,000 to earn $80,000"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer137,ESFP,you can easily go to a coding boot camp
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer138,ESFP,or a data science boot camp and then
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer139,ESFP,just graduate and then rather bad you'll
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer140,ESFP,be earning like 60 or 80 thousand
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer141,ESFP,dollars depends on your your skill level
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer142,ESFP,and where you're from but really in
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer143,ESFP,three or six months with some trade
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer144,ESFP,school type training you can have a very
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer145,ESFP,respectable salary so the idea that you
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer146,ESFP,have to go to four years or five years
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer147,ESFP,of school bachelor's degree to get an
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer148,ESFP,"$80,000 starting salary it's just not"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer149,ESFP,necessary then the last thing I got to
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer150,ESFP,say is a little bit of Matt Tran
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer151,ESFP,philosophy that when you choose a skill
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer152,ESFP,or career choose something that a lot of
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer153,ESFP,companies need so on this channel you'll
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer154,ESFP,see me talk a lot about web development
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer155,ESFP,or about digital marketing because how
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer156,ESFP,many companies need a website a lot of
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer157,ESFP,them and yeah there are services like
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer158,ESFP,WordPress and Shopify that make websites
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer159,ESFP,for a lot of companies where they don't
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer160,ESFP,need a developer but any company that
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer161,ESFP,needs some functionality they need a web
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer162,ESFP,app and that has to be created by a web
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer163,ESFP,"developer so that's why there are 50,000"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer164,ESFP,software engineering jobs available
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer165,ESFP,"compared to only 6,000 for mechanical"
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer166,ESFP,engineers I also encourage people to do
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer167,ESFP,digital marketing because digital
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer168,ESFP,marketing is selling things on the
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer169,ESFP,internet through paid traffic organic
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer170,ESFP,traffic and how many companies out there
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer171,ESFP,need to sell their stuff online it's
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer172,ESFP,like every company so the demand is
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer173,ESFP,insane for digital marketers and so if
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer174,ESFP,you want to learn more about different
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer175,ESFP,careers I have several playlists on my
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer176,ESFP,channel page that you can check out and
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer177,ESFP,if
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer178,ESFP,want to ask me a question I actually do
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer179,ESFP,need more questions for more videos join
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer180,ESFP,my facebook group and gender truth link
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer181,ESFP,will be in the description below I'll
ESFP_Only 1 Out of 10 Engineering Grads Will Work as an Engineer182,ESFP,see you next time

ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife0,ESFP,strange fruit is what we're used to
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife1,ESFP,that's me and
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife2,ESFP,[Music]
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife3,ESFP,all right guys what is up YouTube it's
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife4,ESFP,actually Sunday morning right now it is
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife5,ESFP,about 7:00 a.m. and and I honestly
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife6,ESFP,wanted to make a pretty quick video for
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife7,ESFP,you guys but my last video that I
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife8,ESFP,uploaded I'm fortunate enough to be able
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife9,ESFP,to make these videos in my office right
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife10,ESFP,in my in my building where I actually
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife11,ESFP,wanted to make a living and it's really
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife12,ESFP,cool because my boss actually watches my
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife13,ESFP,videos which is really interesting right
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife14,ESFP,when you think about it because you're
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife15,ESFP,filming in the office it's funny we're
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife16,ESFP,actually talking about my youtube

ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife19,ESFP,or something around that and he told me
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife20,ESFP,how you watched my last video and he was
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife21,ESFP,talking about how he does like my he
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife22,ESFP,liked that video but does one point he
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife23,ESFP,didn't agree with and I'm like oh really
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife24,ESFP,what is it and I was really interested
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife25,ESFP,interested to hear because you know yes
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife26,ESFP,my experience he was a scene in front
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife27,ESFP,developed but he still called that work
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife28,ESFP,too
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife29,ESFP,he told me how when I mentioned in my
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife30,ESFP,video that it should only take you two
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife31,ESFP,or three months to learn HTML and CSS
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife32,ESFP,and he told me fairly quickly that
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife33,ESFP,that's something he doesn't agree with
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife34,ESFP,and I was very interested to hear his
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife35,ESFP,input on that there's so much in regards
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife36,ESFP,to internet and you know when it comes
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife37,ESFP,to HTML CSS because it's more than just
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife38,ESFP,building a Dom right and he gave me a
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife39,ESFP,really good point and so the question
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife40,ESFP,then is right I loan against this how
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife41,ESFP,much HTML and CSS do you really need to
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife42,ESFP,know like how much how much you need to
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife43,ESFP,know how much time you need to spend on
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife44,ESFP,it and this is something that I really
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife45,ESFP,want to talk about right now and I want
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife46,ESFP,to talk about this because almost
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife47,ESFP,everyone that self-taught our friend and
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife48,ESFP,developers a lot of them are they're
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife49,ESFP,back and developers too but a majority
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife50,ESFP,of them are front-end developers because
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife51,ESFP,that's usually what you think of when
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife52,ESFP,you think of code you think of what you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife53,ESFP,can see that's front-end development but
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife54,ESFP,the question is how much do you really
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife55,ESFP,need to know to get off right off the
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife56,ESFP,bat you will never know enough not even
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife57,ESFP,just these languages are changing and
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife58,ESFP,growing but even more than that the
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife59,ESFP,Internet is growing the Internet is
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife60,ESFP,changing there are rules when it comes
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife61,ESFP,to even Google that you have to work
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife62,ESFP,with think coming on the internet that
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife63,ESFP,you have to be able to work around but
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife64,ESFP,one of the main ways you do it as being
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife65,ESFP,able to write effective HTML and
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife66,ESFP,effective CSS how much HTML CSS do you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife67,ESFP,know in two to three
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife68,ESFP,you should at least be able to know how
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife69,ESFP,to build a regular basic website you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife70,ESFP,have your body you are able to build
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife71,ESFP,just a website you put the paragraph
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife72,ESFP,elements you put your copy or text in
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife73,ESFP,there you you know you have a footer you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife74,ESFP,have very basic great that stuff it's
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife75,ESFP,not easy to make as a first-time coder
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife76,ESFP,being able to build a navbar and then
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife77,ESFP,within two to three months you should
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife78,ESFP,make it a goal to make it mobile
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife79,ESFP,friendly and the basics right now I'm so
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife80,ESFP,not really intricate but now out of two
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife81,ESFP,to three months after gifts and this
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife82,ESFP,what my boss told me after someone even
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife83,ESFP,learns that code in two to three months
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife84,ESFP,now to get even better and he's a senior
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife85,ESFP,developer okay seen the front-end
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife86,ESFP,developer now the goal then to be
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife87,ESFP,someone who's really good HTML CSS and
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife88,ESFP,take what she wrote that website that
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife89,ESFP,you made in two to three months using
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife90,ESFP,HTML CSS that made a mobile-friendly now
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife91,ESFP,do it all over again this time don't
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife92,ESFP,even use a tutorial okay he didn't say
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife93,ESFP,that I'm saying this right now but then
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife94,ESFP,what he said is this now do that again
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife95,ESFP,what you made that website but now use
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife96,ESFP,less CSS let's shoot that's true right
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife97,ESFP,now do it again and see if there's a way
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife98,ESFP,to use even less HTML does that make
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife99,ESFP,sense
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife100,ESFP,dan you said now do that same thing but
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife101,ESFP,make it load even faster and so with the
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife102,ESFP,point that he was getting at is that you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife103,ESFP,cannot learn enough HTML CSS in two to
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife104,ESFP,three months to become really good at
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife105,ESFP,that these type of things they're doing
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife106,ESFP,this kind of work on the internet and
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife107,ESFP,the web takes you here is an experience
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife108,ESFP,and making mistakes and learning from
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife109,ESFP,your mistakes but that is what what
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife110,ESFP,development is all about it's not just
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife111,ESFP,making something simple but you get the
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife112,ESFP,job done
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife113,ESFP,dawned what the heck okay I bet you get
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife114,ESFP,the job done but now the goal is how
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife115,ESFP,could it do the exact same thing even
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife116,ESFP,better
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife117,ESFP,how can you make it faster how can you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife118,ESFP,make it a load from page to page and do
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife119,ESFP,the exact same thing or JavaScript okay
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife120,ESFP,so you just learned JavaScript and you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife121,ESFP,learned how to how to page on the click
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife122,ESFP,you learn how to make something load
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife123,ESFP,after three seconds right you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife124,ESFP,and how to do different things we found
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife125,ESFP,a page with JavaScript now do the exact
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife126,ESFP,same thing which you didn't JavaScript
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife127,ESFP,but using more less code now try to make
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife128,ESFP,the page load even faster now try to
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife129,ESFP,implement Ajax now how do you implement
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife130,ESFP,that Ajax call even faster now and you
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife131,ESFP,does that make sense
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife132,ESFP,that's the whole point of this is that
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife133,ESFP,how much HTML CSS do you need to know
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife134,ESFP,you'll never know enough but the big
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife135,ESFP,important factor is how well can you use
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife136,ESFP,it because anyone can build a website
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife137,ESFP,you could just use Google to make a
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife138,ESFP,website with no coding experience is
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife139,ESFP,very easy I'm gonna make a video on that
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife140,ESFP,soon but the question then is how good
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife141,ESFP,are you are using it how effective are
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife142,ESFP,you are using it and if I was gonna add

ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife145,ESFP,something I need to work on even more
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife146,ESFP,than ever to be honest right coding it's
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife147,ESFP,more than just building its building
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife148,ESFP,things well and not even that taking
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife149,ESFP,something that was built very well and
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife150,ESFP,make it even 60% faster 40% faster make
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife151,ESFP,it work look amazing even on an iPhone
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife152,ESFP,or an Angela or whatever browser you're
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife153,ESFP,using right that is how it needs to know

ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife158,ESFP,you're able to do that and know
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife159,ESFP,JavaScript as well people would be crazy
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife160,ESFP,it's not hiring you people will be going
ESFP_HTML & CSS - How Much Do You Really Need To Know? #devsLife161,ESFP,after you why because not many people

ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️100,ESTJc,Korean people are extremely extremely
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️101,ESTJc,straightforward sometimes there are so
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️102,ESTJc,much straight forward that it can get
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️103,ESTJc,too much Laurens are Russians I've been
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️104,ESTJc,there
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️105,ESTJc,Karen Raye if you received some
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️106,ESTJc,compliments from a native Korean that
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️107,ESTJc,means that those compliments are very
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️108,ESTJc,very true and that you deserve this
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️109,ESTJc,compliment we got into compliments I got
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️110,ESTJc,quite a few compliments but some of them
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️111,ESTJc,were really really unusual I will say I
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️112,ESTJc,remember a couple of girls tapping on my
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️113,ESTJc,shoulder and stopping me on the road and
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️114,ESTJc,telling me you you have a very small
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️115,ESTJc,face and I was like okay um thank you
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️116,ESTJc,and of course I knew that if a Korean
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️117,ESTJc,person tells you that you have a small
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️118,ESTJc,face it's a very very good compliment
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️119,ESTJc,because one of the beauty standards in
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️120,ESTJc,Korea is having a small face I just say
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️121,ESTJc,the same thing to Italian people they
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️122,ESTJc,will think you are making fun of them
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️123,ESTJc,because small face means small brain and
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️124,ESTJc,which basically means you're stupid but
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️125,ESTJc,in Korea if you have a small face you're
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️126,ESTJc,lucky if I got that compliment a lot and
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️127,ESTJc,that happen in quite times where people
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️128,ESTJc,will just tell me that I have a small
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️129,ESTJc,faith and they would tell how do you get
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️130,ESTJc,a small face what do you do to get a
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️131,ESTJc,small
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️132,ESTJc,because they are kind of obsessed about
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️133,ESTJc,having a v-shaped face a small face so
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️134,ESTJc,that's why they always make photos like
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️135,ESTJc,this or like this so they can like you
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️136,ESTJc,know I'll sling down maybe their feet
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️137,ESTJc,not that thing that I loved there is a
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️138,ESTJc,huge variety of food so you don't have
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️139,ESTJc,to worry if you are either vegetarian or
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️140,ESTJc,non-vegetarian or vegan and you have
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️141,ESTJc,lots of choices to choose from if that
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️142,ESTJc,makes sense
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️143,ESTJc,and I remember asking to my boyfriend
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️144,ESTJc,how much time do you think it will take
ESTJc_MY FIRST TIME IN KOREA || INDIAN IN KOREA || things I  ❤️145,ESTJc,foreigner to taste all the Korean food

ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health38,ESTJ,(upbeat music)
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health39,ESTJ,I don't do it always with the clean hands
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health40,ESTJ,where I touch every dumbell and barbell

ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health54,ESTJ,I was not always health conscious
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health55,ESTJ,"because when I was young,
you know you get away with"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health56,ESTJ,"a lot of things, a little bit from that."
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health57,ESTJ,"Now I eat more, you know, like"

vegetables, and healthy foods."
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health59,ESTJ,"Stay away more from the meats
and more from animal products,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health60,ESTJ,"and animal proteins, because
there was this misconception"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health61,ESTJ,"that's the only way you get
big and strong, so now I"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health62,ESTJ,"backed off that and, um, I feel"

make a little protein drink"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health76,ESTJ,"of course, because I think it is just"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health77,ESTJ,"the best, ya know, if you
have a lot of proteins."
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health78,ESTJ,"I mix it with, uh, some of the
milk here, and sometimes, uh,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health79,ESTJ,"juices, and then sometimes
I have energy drinks also"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health80,ESTJ,"so it really depends what
kind of a mood that I am in"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health81,ESTJ,"and if I'm tired or not,
because our energy drink"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health82,ESTJ,is really great when you're tired.

ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health87,ESTJ,- [Host] What other foods do you hate?
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health88,ESTJ,"- Um, I don't really
hate much of anything."
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health89,ESTJ,"I just stay away from it
because of health reasons,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health90,ESTJ,"but I mean I always was
called the garbage disposal,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health91,ESTJ,"because I was never sick
and tired of anything."
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health92,ESTJ,I mean anything.
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health93,ESTJ,"As a matter of fact I
would go to restaurants"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health94,ESTJ,"and I would say to ""people
make me an omelet"", and they"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health95,ESTJ,"say ""what do you want in the omelet?"""
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health96,ESTJ,"and I said, ""anything
that's in the kitchen sink"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health97,ESTJ,"""or anything that you can
find on the kitchen floor."
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health98,ESTJ,"""Just scrape it up and put it
in there and I would love it"","
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health99,ESTJ,and that's exactly what they did.
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health100,ESTJ,- [Host] Have you ever tried a fad diet
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health101,ESTJ,like Keto or intermittent fasting?

ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health103,ESTJ,for fad diets or anything like that.
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health104,ESTJ,"I have to go and go on a real
serious kind of a regimen."
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health105,ESTJ,"I work out harder, I do more
cardiovascular training,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health106,ESTJ,"and I watch much more what I eat,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health107,ESTJ,"so I cut out just simply
all the sugar products,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health108,ESTJ,and I cut out all the white bread.

ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health112,ESTJ,"that the body needs, but like I said"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health113,ESTJ,"they're called supplements to
supplement of what you eat,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health114,ESTJ,"so the key thing is not
to rely on the supplements"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health115,ESTJ,as much as you rely on good food.
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health116,ESTJ,"Natural food, a lot of
greens, a lot of fruits,"
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health117,ESTJ,and a lot of really good proteins.
ESTJ_Arnold Schwarzenegger Shows His Gym & Fridge | Gym & Fridge | Men's Health118,ESTJ,"- [Host] Does Arnold

ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity166,ESTJ,to their colleagues who are not exposed
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity167,ESTJ,to natural lighting again if you're
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity168,ESTJ,interested in the topic I will leave all
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity169,ESTJ,links to my research in the description
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity170,ESTJ,so if you can make sure that your
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity171,ESTJ,workspace is close to a window so that
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity172,ESTJ,you're getting natural light and if you
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity173,ESTJ,can't do that make sure you take regular
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity174,ESTJ,breaks and go outside for a walk to get
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity175,ESTJ,that natural light and also get your
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity176,ESTJ,blood flowing and that goes nicely with
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity177,ESTJ,the movement tip another thing that you
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity178,ESTJ,can do is get one of those smart
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity179,ESTJ,daylight lamps I've been super impressed
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity180,ESTJ,by the amount of research on lighting
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity181,ESTJ,and productivity especially by charts
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity182,ESTJ,like this one from online MBA which
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity183,ESTJ,shows you which temperature of light is
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity184,ESTJ,better for what I will also leave a link
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity185,ESTJ,to their article in the description so
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity186,ESTJ,you can check that out as well
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity187,ESTJ,as you can see from this chart different
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity188,ESTJ,warmth of light are better for different
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity189,ESTJ,things and there are lamps that actually
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity190,ESTJ,have all three of those different modes
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity191,ESTJ,a great one that I found is also by up
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity192,ESTJ,of desk and I will leave a link in the
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity193,ESTJ,description it's also LED so it consumes
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity194,ESTJ,much less energy overall and is better
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity195,ESTJ,for the environment and finally but very
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity196,ESTJ,importantly make sure that your
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity197,ESTJ,workspace is free from clutter and is
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity198,ESTJ,organized I don't know about you but I
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity199,ESTJ,can't be productive when there's a mess
ESTJ_5 Ways to Optimise your Workspace to Improve Productivity200,ESTJ,around me I get super distracted by
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart0,ESTJ,I wish I had enough time to cover everything but I don't so I'm gonna pick out kind of the most important things and make sure I get to those
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart1,ESTJ,"right off the bat. So is it going? Okay, I the red light. I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to think for a moment and tell me how long would"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart2,ESTJ,you estimate the typical college freshman can read material in their book or in their notes and effectively be learning what they're reading.
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart3,ESTJ,"Okay. 5 minutes says Chris. 25 minutes. Hour. Now, let me ask, anybody think more then an hour? How long? By the way, I had a"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart4,ESTJ,"guy, last time I did this, he said I can do it about 6 hours. And I just (scoffs). Well then I found out he is a medical resident, just finished"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart5,ESTJ,"medical school, his wife was in my class and indeed, my daughter's 4th year med, oh yeah 4, 5 hours but that's not typical I can tell you, okay."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart6,ESTJ,"Anybody less then 5 minutes? Okay. So we've got 5 to maybe 4 or 5 hours. A study was done, believe the University of Michigan, they asked"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart7,ESTJ,"students to do the following thing. When you're ready to study, you've got all your materials, you're back in your little dorm room or your place"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart8,ESTJ,"you live. Check your watch, start working, the moment you feel that sense of I've read it but it's not coming through, and it's like eh I'm"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart9,ESTJ,"wasting my time, we all get that feeling, note what time it is. Record that, bring it back. And they had many, many hundreds of freshman and"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart10,ESTJ,"sophomores do this and then somebody took the time to compile it. And typically, right about 25 to 30 minutes. By the way, it's also true of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart11,ESTJ,"lectures and you've all proved it to yourself. You come in to a lecture, you're really alert, check the clock at about 25 after it's like...yeah. And I"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart12,ESTJ,"see it in every class I teach but how long do we teach? 50 minutes. And yet probably most of learning, if it's gonna happen, is in the first 25-30."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart13,ESTJ,"Okay. I'm gonna talk about a person cause I also like to teach by anecdote. Woman named Janette. I was a junior at Western, she was a"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart14,ESTJ,"freshman, because I was a junior I could live off campus, those days, colleges where your parents had abstentia. She had to live in a dorm"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart15,ESTJ,"cause she didn't have a relative in town. We were dating. She got her first quarter at Western a D average, 1.0, 15 credits of D. She decided"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart16,ESTJ,"she really needed to buckle down, plus the school said if you don't make it up you're gonna be kicked out. So the second quarter of her freshman"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart17,ESTJ,"year, she set the following goal, to study for 6 hours a night, non-stop, 6-midnight, Sunday night through Thursday night. Friday, Saturday she"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart18,ESTJ,"could party, rest of the week she was gonna study. Now one would assume, my gosh going from little study to 6 hours a night, 5 nights"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart19,ESTJ,"of the week, she should've aced everything. Want to guess her grade point second quarter? 0.0, she failed every class. This is why telling"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart20,ESTJ,people to study more is not necessarily help. In some cases it might actually worsen their performance. What I want to do is show you
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart21,ESTJ,"graphically what I'm talking about. Let's say this is efficient studying, and I know there are no numbers there but higher means more efficient,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart22,ESTJ,"lower means low or no efficiency. And this axis we're looking at time. Here's what happens for the average student. For her, 6 o' clock in"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart23,ESTJ,"the evening, after her supper at the residency dining hall, she plopped herself down at her little study area and started studying. Here's what"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart24,ESTJ,"happened. By about 6:30, she was in a major slump. But what was her goal? To study 6 hours, so she continued to sit at her little desk and"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart25,ESTJ,"stare at pages until midnight. She was at her desk 6 hours. How long did she actually study? About 20, 30 minutes. Now, there's a simple"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart26,ESTJ,"conduct in psychology all of you are aware of, things that are reinforced we tend to do more of. Things that are punished or ignored, we tend to"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart27,ESTJ,"do less of, and we operate by those principles to a large degree. If you are sitting there for 6 hours, are you feeling good? No. Once you get"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart28,ESTJ,"here, you're looking at your book going I hate geography, I hate literature, I hate psychology, all the things we're trying to get you to"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart29,ESTJ,"fall in love with, you're hating it. And so her actual good studying was followed by 5 and a half hours of pain and misery. I would bet you, I"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart30,ESTJ,"don't know for a fact, that as the quarter progressed she sat down and finally she was done before she even started. She sat down and just"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart31,ESTJ,"stared at a book and she flunked every class. Now, had she taken this little seminar or had figured things out on her own, she'd know what to"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart32,ESTJ,"do. First rule, the moment you start to slide, you're shoveling against the tide. What you need to do is what? Take a break. Here's what's cool"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart33,ESTJ,about it. You can study for a half hour. It doesn't take a half hour break to recharge your batteries. For most people about 5 minutes. This is
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart34,ESTJ,"where you go away, do something fun for 5 minutes. Call a friend, talk to a child, talk to a parent, a roommate, enjoy some music, do something"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart35,ESTJ,"you enjoy and actually say this is my treat for having studied for 30 minutes effectively. Go back, and here's what happens. Your efficiency"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart36,ESTJ,"is nearly 100%. Study a half hour, take a break, study a half hour. Had she done that over a course of 6 hours, she would have got about 5 and"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart37,ESTJ,a half hours of serious studying and about a half hour of total break time. I really don't believe she would've flunked out. Now I get students
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart38,ESTJ,complaining I don't have enough time to study. Look for a break at work. Look for a break at home. Those little 15-20 minutes can be very
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart39,ESTJ,"efficient if you apply them efficiently. Unfortunately, sometimes it's really tough to get those moments but you need to build them in somehow."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart40,ESTJ,You gotta have at least sometime to study. It's not gonna happen through osmosis. I'm gonna ask you a final question. Lets say you've
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart41,ESTJ,"studied till midnight, what do you want to do after your last study 20-30 minutes? No, not yet. You want to give yourself a big treat, okay."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart42,ESTJ,"Whenever you're studying time is done, plan something special. Now for most women, especially with kids, it's a calgon bath with candles and"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart43,ESTJ,"the bathroom door locked and the statement if you bother me I will take your head off. This is where guys go ""what?"" Yeah, moms have no"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart44,ESTJ,"privacy, kids walk in while you're using the toilet, while you're in the tub, they'll bring their friends with them, won't they? Dads don't put up with"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart45,ESTJ,"that. When dads are in the bathroom it's lock the door, tough luck, go elsewhere. For you guys, I'll give you mine. This is politically incorrect."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart46,ESTJ,"I liked beer, kay. My goal was to knock out all my studying, go to the Iron Bull Tavern in Bellingham, knock down a couple beers for my treat. Now"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart47,ESTJ,"my buddies they'd say Lobdell how're you getting straight A's? Well I'd studied starting about 3 in the afternoon. By 9 o' clock at night, when"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart48,ESTJ,"pitchers went on cheap, I'd done all my studying. I went and enjoyed my beer. These yahoos started drinking in the afternoon, then went to the"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart49,ESTJ,"tavern planning to go home and study. You know that's not gonna happen. You're not gonna study, and even if you do, what's called state"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart50,ESTJ,dependent memory you'll typically only remember if you're intoxicated and I don't recommend getting drunk before a test. It's kind of a stupid
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart51,ESTJ,"thing. If you plan your day right, you can have those little study breaks but the coolest part is this. Because you're now reinforcing it with those"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart52,ESTJ,"little breaks and something fun, you extended. And you'll find you can go 30, 40, 50, an hour, an hour and a half. This is training. Those of you"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart53,ESTJ,"who go on to advanced degrees, you're gonna have to study incredible lengths of time without taking a break cause you've gotta get it done"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart54,ESTJ,"like my daughter in med school. Just amazing, I've told her I couldn't do it now, or actually I wouldn't do it. You're training yourself and if you do it"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart55,ESTJ,"right it becomes progressively easier, okay next question. How many of you have a true study or library in your place of residence? Okay. 2, 2 of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart56,ESTJ,"you if I'm seeing correctly. I've always envied that. A quiet place to actually do reading or studying, kay. I'm gonna make a predicition."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart57,ESTJ,"Many of you study in your bedroom. Okay, how many of you study in your bedroom? We'll raise high so everybody can see. Mmhmm, that's"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart58,ESTJ,"where I studied a lot, especially when I did go to community college. If you don't study in your bedroom hmm...I bet some of you study at the"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart59,ESTJ,dining room table/kitchen table or bar. How many of you study at the dining/kitchen/bar? Okay. Now if you don't study in those 2 places and
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart60,ESTJ,"you don't have a study or library, study in the family room/rec room/living room...the place where your TV and stereo is, your couch, easy chair."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart61,ESTJ,"How many of you study there? Okay. Now some of you might actually might drive to a school or library, any do that? Go to a...okay. A few of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart62,ESTJ,"you do. I still remember living at home going to Highline Community College, my folks bought me a little desk. I still have it. Little desk, I'd"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart63,ESTJ,"come home cause I did work then at Albertsons, typically got off at 9, home about 10 and I'd start studying. I still remember reading Billy Bud"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart64,ESTJ,"Melville. I lie there sitting there studying and my eyes are just...and then the bed started calling to me. ""Marty, come lie upon me."" Now those of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart65,ESTJ,"you who've studied Greek, the idea of Sirens calling sailors to the rocks, oh it's real. I'd hear the bed call me and I'd finally go oh I'll just lie down"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart66,ESTJ,"for a moment. Next thing my mom to be yelling ""Marty you're late for your English class"" I was like ""Oh god. I didn't read Billy Bud and I'm"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart67,ESTJ,"screwed."" Let me ask you, what's the primary function of a bedroom? What's the secondary function? Good. Most groups go...and I go take"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart68,ESTJ,"psych 20..or 225 and learn about it. It's functional, okay. Primary function of a dining table, eating. Primary function of a living area..."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart69,ESTJ,"Recreation, socializing, right? Now, a lot of students don't realize how much we're controlled by environmental cues. How many of you have"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart70,ESTJ,"been to the Tacoma Mall? Funny, isn't it? Why do you raise your hand? Have you ever been to Tacoma? You answered, why didn't you go like"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart71,ESTJ,"this? Why? Cause if I'm asking the entire class, you've been trained to do what? And you don't even think about it. How many of you been"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart72,ESTJ,"Tacoma Mall? Hands go up. But if I walked up to you, Chris you ever been to Seattle? Totally stupid right? When you're talking face to face"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart73,ESTJ,"you respond verbally. When you ask a group, hands come up. Now, here's what's bad...now that I've tricked you, you won't raise your"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart74,ESTJ,"hands. I'm not gonna raise my hand. But can you see how powerful it is? Without thinking cause we're in a classroom, how many of you have"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart75,ESTJ,"been to Tacoma Mall, hands shoot up. Same is true of going in your bedroom and trying to study. You're in the bedroom. Now, piece of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart76,ESTJ,"research done in University of Hawaii. Researchers asked the students what's the biggest problem with studying, they said we can't get into it."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart77,ESTJ,The university in question had primarily dorm rooms. Very few commuter students to the university. Most of you have seen a dorm
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart78,ESTJ,"room. Oh okay. Most of you have seen a dorm room. They're usually rectangular if it's a 2 plex. One side bed, other side a bed, everything"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart79,ESTJ,"kinda mirror imaged, study area, study area, right...You've got a closet or wardrobe so it's real interesting. In one room you sleep, you groom,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart80,ESTJ,"talk with people, you socialize, you study, you snack, you're all in 1 room. It's a multi-purpose room and yet you're supposed to study. If"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart81,ESTJ,"your door's open, what happens? Everybody ""Hey Lobdell what's up?!"" You know and then they got to come in and talk to very quickly you can't"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart82,ESTJ,get to study. Well the professors heard that the students couldn't get into studying. But they knew what the dorms looked like and the Hawaiin
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart83,ESTJ,"dorms, all of the rooms had a goose neck lamp, so the professors said we're gonna try a little experiment. Take that lamp, make a little sign and"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart84,ESTJ,"put it on it, ""Study Lamp"". Use it only for studying, you don't dress by it, you don't have bs sessions by it, you don't snack by it, you don't clean"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart85,ESTJ,"the room by it, nothing. You use the other lights for all other functions. Here's the way it works and it's so easy. Every one of you can do this."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart86,ESTJ,"Get a little lamp, probably have one already, if you don't my gosh. Yard sale, garage sale, you can pick 'em up for nothing. Get that lamp and it"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart87,ESTJ,"becomes your study lamp, so if you have to study in your bedroom, turn your desk away from the bed. That's the like how many of you been to"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart88,ESTJ,"the mall, it makes you want to go to sleep. By the way, you can't study in the bed, it's also bad for your back if you know about posture. Turn your"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart89,ESTJ,"back to the bed, have a blank wall, have your lamp, have your books ready to go cause you could futz away a lot of time getting ready, can't"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart90,ESTJ,"you? How many of can futz and futz yeah? You're ready to go, turn on the lamp and start studying. The moment you lose your edge, 15 20 30"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart91,ESTJ,"minutes later, turn the lamp off, get up and leave the desk. What you're training yourself to study while seated there, and it becomes"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart92,ESTJ,"increasingly automatic as did the raising of the hand. You sit, turn the lamp on and you're ready to go. It's like magic. The students who did"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart93,ESTJ,that were 1 grade point higher the next term compared to the controlled group that didn't do it. 1 grade point simply by creating a study area.
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart94,ESTJ,"Now if you study in the kitchen/dining, remove all food cues cause I know what happens there. You start thinking turkey in the fridge, yeah"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart95,ESTJ,"swiss cheese in the fridge, oh yeah sandwich time. How many of you have studied and created sandwiches, takes about a half hour to make"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart96,ESTJ,"a really good one. So damn good, what do you do? Make another one! And pretty soon not only are you not studying, but you're getting the"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart97,ESTJ,"spread going, okay. You're really frustrated then. The living area, I'm gonna tell you, you can do this experiment. You try to study in the living"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart98,ESTJ,"room and you're focused, and other people are listening to music, watching a movie, watching TV, they won't leave you alone. ""Hey"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart99,ESTJ,"Marty. Marty look, look look it's really good."" ""Excuse me I'm studying."" And then they get angry at you. ""Well boo on you too."" You can't study"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart100,ESTJ,"in the living area. It's not designed for that unless you're all by yourself, and you turn off the TV, turn down the stereo so it's truly background. If"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart101,ESTJ,"you're singing along to your favorite song, you're not studying. You're singing along to a song. Your brain has to be focused to be really"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart102,ESTJ,"studying, not time sharing back and forth between singing and studying. So living areas, very tough to create but if that's what you have to do it"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart103,ESTJ,"bring your little study lamp in, everything else off, turn on your study lamp, create a study there. Are you getting the idea? Now, I'm gonna"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart104,ESTJ,"go through a lot of suggestions. Break it up into chunks, reinforce it, simple to do. Create a study area, simple to do. And you'll be amazed"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart105,ESTJ,"if you take these ideas and do them. I'm gonna make a challenge to all of you. It's so easy to sit through a presentation, say yeah yeah that"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart106,ESTJ,"sounds good and then walk away and do nothing. Technically as a psychologist, if it doesn't change your behavior you haven't learned it."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart107,ESTJ,It's just in your head. To be a true learning experience you have to behave differently. So my hope is you all make a promise I'll try at
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart108,ESTJ,"least one or 2 of what I talk about today, and when you find out it works, say gosh I'll try a 3rd one, maybe a 4th. I went back to grad school in"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart109,ESTJ,"the mid-80s, second time around, I actually aced every class. PLU gives pluses, I got pluses in all but one class. I didn't do that first time, okay. I"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart110,ESTJ,was a good student but not that good. I used the principles I learned about in teaching psych to become a student. I wish somebody had told
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart111,ESTJ,me these things when I was a student the first time. It would have been a lot easier. So we got 2 things going. Break your study up into little
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart112,ESTJ,"pieces with reinforcement. Create a study area, if you don't have one. I think you said you do have a study. There you go. Okay. Next thing. The"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart113,ESTJ,"more active you are in your learning, your're more effective. And yet increasingly I have students who think studying is reading it over and"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart114,ESTJ,"over and they're gonna have some magical thing where they suddenly understand it and remember it well. When your reading it over and over,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart115,ESTJ,"or saying it over and over, the term for that is rote memorization. Spelled r-o-t-e. It can work. It is the way most of us were taught in elementary"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart116,ESTJ,"school. The way I understand it, a lot of Asian schools depend heavily on rote. Some of you may be darn good at it and if you can memorize"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart117,ESTJ,"and actually understand by repetition and its effective for you, don't change. But for most of us it's not the most efficient or effective way."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart118,ESTJ,"The way to learn efficiently in college, first you have to decide what am I learning. Is it a concept or a fact? A fast is the discreet little piece of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart119,ESTJ,"information, Sigmund Freud is the father of psychoanalysis, that's a fact. Okay, but understanding what psychoanalysis is is a concept. Okay."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart120,ESTJ,"Understanding the name of a bone is a fact. Understanding what it does in the body gets into a concept, okay. So, in studying, sometimes there"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart121,ESTJ,"are a lot of facts. In fact, I use anatomy as a good example. You gotta memorize bones, muscles, organs, tissues, a lot of it. But if you simply"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart122,ESTJ,"memorize and don't understand the function of it. The comprehension of the actual concepts, it's a lot of wasted learning, really. Just to know a"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart123,ESTJ,"name of a bone is like yeah, so what. Okay. What does it do? How does it function? So, if it's a fact or a factoid, you have to approach it one way"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart124,ESTJ,"and I'll talk about how you do that. But in most college classes, what we as professors are most concerned about is that you grasp the concept."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart125,ESTJ,"Because concepts, once grasped, will stay with you a lifetime. Facts can easily get confused, but that's why we have Google, why we have"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart126,ESTJ,"reference books. If you know the concept, you can quickly look up the fact if you have to know that for a particular fact. Neat thing is, I get"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart127,ESTJ,"questions who has more advantage, younger students or older students? Depends on what you're talking about. Most of us as we get"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart128,ESTJ,"older realize concepts are what are really important to make our lives better, to be effective in our work, effective in our personal lives. Facts"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart129,ESTJ,"though, we realize we can lookup. We can get those if we need them. Young people actually often learn facts very quickly but they never think"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart130,ESTJ,"about the concept. I'll give you a simple example, I'm an old guy, when I was a bit younger, I would sing along with the radio with my adolescent"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart131,ESTJ,"daughter in the car. Oh Dad, if you don't know the words don't sing the song. I'd say okay Beth, you're right. I'm not singing exactly what he or"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart132,ESTJ,"she is singing, but it's conceptually the same. What? I'd say what's the song about? I don't know. She couldn't tell me what the song was about"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart133,ESTJ,"but she could tell me every word in the song. That's earning or learning facts and not seeing the concept. I as an adult, I know the concept, I just"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart134,ESTJ,"make up my own lyrics, okay. Because I don't worry about the factual. Now, some of you are going yeah but my teacher does. I got to know"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart135,ESTJ,"the facts as well as the concepts, so we'll first deal with concepts. Here's the question, can you put the concept in your own words. If you"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart136,ESTJ,"can't, you don't really understand it. It's not meaningful to you. To make it meaningful is a struggle. It's probably the biggest struggle you have as"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart137,ESTJ,a student. But its a struggle you need to do or you're wasting your study time. Now I'm gonna give you an example. Only 1 of you probably in this
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart138,ESTJ,room will understand what I just say or what we say. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. I knew she would get that. How many of you
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart139,ESTJ,"know exactly what I'm talking about? Rog, you do? Cool. 2 of you. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Most of you are going it's all Greek to me, it's"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart140,ESTJ,"actually probably more Latin but I'm not certain of that. When I was a biology student, I learned about the ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny and if you try"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart141,ESTJ,"to learn that and you don't understand it, it's gonna go in one ear and out the other. You can't hold onto it. But if I take a moment to break it down, ontogeny"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart142,ESTJ,"means your own development as a being. You as a human for example. Recapitulates means goes back through or recaptures, retraces. Phylogeny,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart143,ESTJ,"which is the development all the way from single cell to complex mammal. Now to make sense of that, how did all of you start in utero? A single"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart144,ESTJ,"fertilized cell. An ovum that's fertilized and then it starts dividing and you get all that. But you get a little peer and this is what they first looked at embryos,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart145,ESTJ,"where we look like a little thing that looks like a tadpole. Right? Yeah, tadpoleish. So we start with a single egg that's fertilized and then we get this"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart146,ESTJ,"little thing that looks kinda like a tadpole and they thought these were gill slits. They're not, they're just what becomes the pharisaic area. But there's no legs"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart147,ESTJ,"it looks like a little tail. We had a tail! Got the idea? Well then we get our arm buds and we get them growing you know, so we now get arms and legs and"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart148,ESTJ,"gradually we start looking more like a human being but we take an embryo of every mammal, you probably couldn't tell one from the other. Human, pig,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart149,ESTJ,"doesn't matter, they all look very much alike don't they? Now, you understand ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, but if the instructor doesn't take the time to"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart150,ESTJ,"tell you that and you just read it and eh whatever I'll memorize it, you would forget it about as quickly get through it. I'm not gonna prove this, you all get"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart151,ESTJ,"to do a little memory task. Gotta find where...here we go! I'm gonna read to you 13 letters from our alphabet, you all know the alphabet right? Should be"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart152,ESTJ,meaningful. As soon as I finish I want you to say them back to me in the same sequence that I give them to you. So I'll say them and then I'll go
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart153,ESTJ,"like that, you say 'em back. Y-T-R-H, don't write 'em, A-U-S-P-D-P-A-Y-H...Boy, somebody sounded like they got quite a few but did any of you get"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart154,ESTJ,"all 13? By the way, the fact that you took notes is a good thing. It's one of the best things to help you remember, and I sit in front of classes where they just"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart155,ESTJ,"go...for 50 minutes. I'm givin' them wisdom and they're not taking a damn note, and then they wonder why they don' remember. You can't remember"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart156,ESTJ,"everything in a lecture. I'm gonna rearrange the letters a little bit, see if you do any better. H-A-P-P-Y-T-H-U-R-S-D-A-Y. The letters in sequence. Shh..."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart157,ESTJ,"letters. Most of you got all 13, and you thought coming to this lecture might be nothing. I've just taken your short term memory span, which is usually 5"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart158,ESTJ,"to about 9 letters and expanded 13. Can you give 'em again? What are they? Damn you're good. Or I'm good. Now, obviously it was a little easier. Those"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart159,ESTJ,"were the same 13 letters, same ones. If you're studying anything conceptual, and you're trying to memorize it, it's like Y-T-R...it doesn't make any sense."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart160,ESTJ,"It's in one eye out the other, if it's out loud one ear out the other. But if you take the time discover the meaning, suddenly it clicks. And I could probably"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart161,ESTJ,ask you next week what were those 13 letters and most of you tell me. At the end of the quarter I could ask you and most of you could tell me. You might
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart162,ESTJ,"be confused was it happy wednesday or thursday but you'd guess probably thursday. Now, some of you are in my intro class this quarter. I do something"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart163,ESTJ,"that I wish I had time to do. I divide the class in 2, using a card so half reads 1, the other half reads another card. I have one group try to estimate the"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart164,ESTJ,"number of vowels in a series of words that I read to them. So they're thinking about the words, we'd say that's superficial thinking. How many vowels in"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart165,ESTJ,mosquito? How many vowels in bottle? How many vowels in elephant? And they get to write down what they think is the number of vowels. The second
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart166,ESTJ,"group are instructed, they're told you need to think about how valuable this item would be. If you were stranded on a deserted island, and you then rate"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart167,ESTJ,"its value on 5 point scale, 1 being no value, 5 being highly valuable, that's called deeper processing. You're now thinking about it in terms of its"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart168,ESTJ,"application or use. By the way, I think elephant is a fun one, I'd give it a 5. Not really company but if you got really hungry you got a lot of food there right? I"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart169,ESTJ,"then read, I think it's about 30 words, everybody's writing down their numbers. I then have them do a stalling exercise where they write their name"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart170,ESTJ,"phone number and address, that's to dump short term memory cause they might be thinking about the words I just read. If you're now writing your name"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart171,ESTJ,"and address, it changes your focus. Short term memory only lasts about 20-30 seconds, its pretty brief. So I counted on the clock, after 30 seconds I say"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart172,ESTJ,"now write down as many words that you can recall. This one is so powerful, the group that's counting vowels on average remembers out of about 30"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart173,ESTJ,"words. Time and time again. The group that's thinking about usefulness on a deserted island remembers 10. It's slightly more 5/5, 5.5 vs 10.5 but very"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart174,ESTJ,"close to it doubling without doing any more effort, simply by thinking about it instead of just trying to superficially think about it. And this is where, as a"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart175,ESTJ,"student, the more you get into the understanding the better. Now this then raises a fun question, what is the meaning? If I say something is meaningful"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart176,ESTJ,"or meaningless, what am I really saying? Now I'm not gonna through a big drill which is kind of fun of teasing it out of you, but a meaningful piece is a"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart177,ESTJ,"piece that relates to something you already know, and the best little analogy is its like a file system that you've already got established, you add a new"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart178,ESTJ,"entry to it so its all neatly organized and its very easy if you got a file system to add a new entry. We do it with computers also. The other way,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart179,ESTJ,meaningless. It's where something new doesn't fit with something already established and so its Greek to you. Its ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart180,ESTJ,"What did you say? If its something brand new, you can't relate it. You have to create a new entry, so you have to grapple with it saying what does that"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart181,ESTJ,"mean? But as I broke it down, I bet you could associate it with something you already understood. You've probably all seen little embryos, you got the idea"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart182,ESTJ,"of an egg, the idea that it kinda recaptures our development from a primitive one cell to a very complex mammal, get that idea. That's the meaning of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart183,ESTJ,"meaningfulness. Now as a teacher, I think all of us, as we are teachers we all try to make things meaningful in our classes. So we give stories, we give"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart184,ESTJ,"examples, but sometimes our examples don't work for you. This is where you have to tease it out. So I'm gonna go to a couple things to help you there."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart185,ESTJ,"First, study groups. We underutilize them, especially in community college. Would people get through med school without study groups. Not very many."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart186,ESTJ,"Do we have vet tech back there? Dental hygiene, vet tech, pretty sophisticated stuff they have to learn, right? Do they do study groups? No?"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart187,ESTJ,"Oh my...I would hope they do. I would encourage them to do it. Where I've got students to form study groups, performance of the groups go up"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart188,ESTJ,"dramatically. Now, part of it is probably because they're motivated to do that so its a bit confounding but I'm convinced there's also the power of"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart189,ESTJ,"studying with other people. I know these concepts its like so well I can't see how they're confusing, but another student who's just found the"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart190,ESTJ,"answer can sometimes turn and say Thursday, here's what its about. They go ah is that what Mr. Lobdell was saying, god. So easy. But I"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart191,ESTJ,can't do that because I don't see where the problems lie in that particular concept. Study groups are great. I'm not gonna tell you how
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart192,ESTJ,"many of you totally hurt yourself in studying. How many of you magic mark, highlight, whatever you call it, textbooks. A little yellow, pink,"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart193,ESTJ,"green, glow in the dark sort of thing? How many of you use the markers? Those were invented '65, year I started college. So I"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart194,ESTJ,"bought one. I turned entire books ugly orange. Then I figured it out. If you color your page solid orange, you've actually highlighted nothing."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart195,ESTJ,"Yeah, by highlighting everything you've really highlighted zip. So I did the clever thing and you guys are way ahead of me. What do you"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart196,ESTJ,"highlight folks? The most important thing. When do you do it? When you first read the book right? Or the chapter. So you read through, are you"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart197,ESTJ,"studying? No, I'm reading for the most important things. Zip, zip, zip...some of you get out rulers to make it really neat, take hours to"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart198,ESTJ,"make pretty little...then you go back to the start of the chapter, you read the first thing you underlined and you go I remember that. No you don't."
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart199,ESTJ,"You recognize it. People are incredible at confusing recognition with recollection. Your visual recognition threshold is so great, you can see a"
ESTJ_Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart200,ESTJ,person once see 'em years later and go I know you. Were you a student at Pierce College? Yeah. Did you take psych? Yeah. From Lobdell?

ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking55,ENTJ,I don't know how it would be growing up
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking56,ENTJ,in this technological age
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking57,ENTJ,if I had been born with
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking58,ENTJ,in my brain I would function intuitively
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking59,ENTJ,with
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking60,ENTJ,I don't know
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking61,ENTJ,I don't personally deal well with
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking62,ENTJ,abstraction
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking63,ENTJ,I need things to be concrete I mean
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking64,ENTJ,Britain
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking65,ENTJ,we need to get them in my brain
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking66,ENTJ,I don't do
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking67,ENTJ,just hearing something I need to see it
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking68,ENTJ,and for kids that are going
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking69,ENTJ,like me
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking70,ENTJ,when I did learn that
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking71,ENTJ,more functions than
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking72,ENTJ,sensation and think
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking73,ENTJ,and that intuition and
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking74,ENTJ,terribly important
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking75,ENTJ,it opened a home
ENTJ_Type Theory of Carl G Jung: Dominant Extraverted Thinking76,ENTJ,we a long long time

ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 120,ISTP,hi I'm Kate Roy welcome to my channel at
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 121,ISTP,the beginning of this year I uploaded a
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 122,ISTP,video called 17 goals for 2017 as a type
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 123,ISTP,of New Year's resolution / birthday
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 124,ISTP,resolutions video and today I thought
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 125,ISTP,that I would reflect on those goals that
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 126,ISTP,I had made at the beginning of the year
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 127,ISTP,and see how I did get a master's degree
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 128,ISTP,check I have several videos on my
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 129,ISTP,channel about my master's program and my
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1210,ISTP,dissertation and all of that so I will
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1211,ISTP,leave a link to that playlist up here if
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1212,ISTP,you're interested read the Bible
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1213,ISTP,everyday I failed this halfway through I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1214,ISTP,was using the Bible app and they have
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1215,ISTP,different plans on there to help you
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1216,ISTP,read through the Bible in a year or read
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1217,ISTP,through like certain themes in the Bible
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1218,ISTP,so I was following that but I kind of
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1219,ISTP,stopped in the summer and then it yeah
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1220,ISTP,once you stop is really hard to start up
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1221,ISTP,again but maybe maybe this year or maybe
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1222,ISTP,next year 2018 will be the year travel
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1223,ISTP,to five countries I have never been to
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1224,ISTP,before I think I accomplished not five
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1225,ISTP,but most of it I went to Croatia
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1226,ISTP,Slovenia Portugal all for the first time
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1227,ISTP,I also went to Scotland for the first
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1228,ISTP,time and I know it's part of the UK but
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1229,ISTP,it is separate from England in a way and
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1230,ISTP,then I went to the Netherlands which I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1231,ISTP,have been to before because I went to
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1232,ISTP,Amsterdam for like a layover between
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1233,ISTP,busses so I was only there for a couple
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1234,ISTP,of hours but this year I was there for
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1235,ISTP,three days so I think I will count that
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1236,ISTP,because that was the first time I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1237,ISTP,properly went and visited go bungee
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1238,ISTP,jumping I did not go bungee jumping this
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1239,ISTP,year we had planned to maybe go
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1240,ISTP,ziplining in Croatia but that ended up
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1241,ISTP,not working in our schedule and yeah I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1242,ISTP,said never ended up going bungee jumping
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1243,ISTP,I don't know if I will have an
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1244,ISTP,opportunity to in 2018 and I don't know
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1245,ISTP,if I really want to anymore I keep going
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1246,ISTP,back and forth between wanting to do it
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1247,ISTP,and then feeling scared about it so
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1248,ISTP,we'll see take active steps to overcome
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1249,ISTP,worrying
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1250,ISTP,somewhat this is always just a struggle
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1251,ISTP,for me but the way that I get
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1252,ISTP,phases of feeling really worried is just
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1253,ISTP,reminding myself that all the other
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1254,ISTP,previous times that I had these similar
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1255,ISTP,kinds of worries everything turned out
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1256,ISTP,to be okay and actually not just okay
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1257,ISTP,usually it turns out better than I could
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1258,ISTP,have wanted or expected so I remind
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1259,ISTP,myself of that and that helps me to stop
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1260,ISTP,focusing in on little details not
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1261,ISTP,worrying me so much cook a three-course
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1262,ISTP,plant-based meal for my friends or
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1263,ISTP,family I did not do this I did cook a
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1264,ISTP,Thanksgiving meal for my family but that
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1265,ISTP,was obviously not vegan even though I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1266,ISTP,could have tried to make it vegan and I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1267,ISTP,have cooked vegan single course meals
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1268,ISTP,for my family but I have yet to cook a
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1269,ISTP,three-course meal that is all
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1270,ISTP,plant-based raised money for a charity I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1271,ISTP,also did not do this one I feel like I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1272,ISTP,didn't do a lot of these but maybe for
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1273,ISTP,my birthday coming up next month if I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1274,ISTP,find something that resonates with me
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1275,ISTP,maybe I'll do if I don't want to just do
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1276,ISTP,any old charity I want to make sure it's
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1277,ISTP,something that I really am passionate
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1278,ISTP,about watch three musicals or plays I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1279,ISTP,did do this I saw lots and lots of
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1280,ISTP,performances while I was in London I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1281,ISTP,took advantage of their like lottery and
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1282,ISTP,day seats systems for some of the shows
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1283,ISTP,that are going on over there so I saw
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1284,ISTP,The Kite Runner and I did like add a
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1285,ISTP,seat thing for that I lined up early in
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1286,ISTP,the morning and then bought two tickets
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1287,ISTP,for like 20 pounds each but they were
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1288,ISTP,front-row Center so that was really cool
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1289,ISTP,I saw the Curious Incident of the dog in
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1290,ISTP,the night-time and that one I also got
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1291,ISTP,desi tickets I saw Leigh miserab twice I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1292,ISTP,saw Harry Potter and the cursed child
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1293,ISTP,which was I can't wait to watch it again
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1294,ISTP,in New York if I get the opportunity and
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1295,ISTP,I also saw the Book of Mormon visit or
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1296,ISTP,revisit a museum each month I don't
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1297,ISTP,think I went to a museum every month in
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1298,ISTP,London but I did like go quite often
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 1299,ISTP,like I've been to the Tate Modern many
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12100,ISTP,many times because it's someone near my
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12101,ISTP,dorm that I lived in and I would also
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12102,ISTP,take a lot of friends to Borough Market
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12103,ISTP,and then
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12104,ISTP,they're just walk to the Tate Modern
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12105,ISTP,because it's a really easy walk so I've
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12106,ISTP,gotten there a bunch of times I've been
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12107,ISTP,to the National Gallery a bunch of times
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12108,ISTP,also been to the Design Museum Victoria
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12109,ISTP,and Albert the Wellcome collection and
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12110,ISTP,maybe a couple others but definitely
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12111,ISTP,didn't go every single month but I think
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12112,ISTP,I made up for it wander around London
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12113,ISTP,without GPS for one day I didn't do like
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12114,ISTP,a dedicated day without GPS but I did
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12115,ISTP,get to a point where I could get around
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12116,ISTP,not just to like really familiar places
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12117,ISTP,but just like get around London without
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12118,ISTP,needing to pull out my google maps or
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12119,ISTP,anything
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12120,ISTP,I did like use city mapper to see like
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12121,ISTP,when the buses would be coming but in
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12122,ISTP,general I got to the point where I could
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12123,ISTP,go around without needing navigation all
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12124,ISTP,the time so I didn't do it for a whole
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12125,ISTP,day but I think I became familiar enough
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12126,ISTP,with the city to get her around on my
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12127,ISTP,own stop checking social media first
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12128,ISTP,thing in the morning definitely did it
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12129,ISTP,do that take a kickboxing class no I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12130,ISTP,still want to do that donate blood for
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12131,ISTP,the first time I still have not donated
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12132,ISTP,blood maybe maybe this year will finally
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12133,ISTP,be the year it was kind of tricky to
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12134,ISTP,like try to donate blood while I was in
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12135,ISTP,England now that I am settled back in
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12136,ISTP,the States
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12137,ISTP,maybe I will try to do that write a song
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12138,ISTP,I haven't like written a whole song I do
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12139,ISTP,have this song that I've been working on
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12140,ISTP,that is about Paris and has just this
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12141,ISTP,like light you know Parisian feel to it
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12142,ISTP,but I don't have a bridge or yet I just
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12143,ISTP,have like a couple verses and the chorus
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12144,ISTP,but yeah maybe maybe one day soon I will
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12145,ISTP,be able to share that one exercise four
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12146,ISTP,times a week so I did do this for the
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12147,ISTP,first like quarter of the year while I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12148,ISTP,was still going to swim training and
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12149,ISTP,stuff when it was still the swim season
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12150,ISTP,but once it was like spring break and on
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12151,ISTP,the summer I lost any sort of exercise
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12152,ISTP,routine I went running for the first
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12153,ISTP,time in like seven months
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12154,ISTP,on Thanksgiving Day so yeah that's where
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12155,ISTP,I'm at with exercising take extra time
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12156,ISTP,to moisturize this is like the kind of
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12157,ISTP,weird one but I have really dry skin I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12158,ISTP,did kind of start moisturizing more
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12159,ISTP,often I started using this body shop
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12160,ISTP,soothing aloe gel that is supposed to be
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12161,ISTP,good for dry skin so I've been trying to
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12162,ISTP,use that more often and I do think it's
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12163,ISTP,helping and my last goal of 2017 was not
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12164,ISTP,to stress out if I'm not meeting every
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12165,ISTP,single goal and I think I met that goal
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12166,ISTP,because this is the first time I'm
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12167,ISTP,really revisiting my goals since I made
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12168,ISTP,that video I think I think I did okay I
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12169,ISTP,guess I will probably make another list
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12170,ISTP,of goals that I want to achieve in 2018
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12171,ISTP,it's gonna be a big year because I am
ISTP_Reviewing My 2017 Resolutions | Vlogmas Day 12172,ISTP,moving away from LA stay tuned to find

ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)8,ENFJ,so I really wanted to film this because
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)9,ENFJ,I actually went to the doctor's office
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)10,ENFJ,three times this week which is something
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)11,ENFJ,that I do not typically do in
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)12,ENFJ,Switzerland I guess since I've been
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)13,ENFJ,living in Switzerland on and off and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)14,ENFJ,going to school here and that kind of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)15,ENFJ,stuff I always put off anything medical
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)16,ENFJ,until I was back in the US so usually
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)17,ENFJ,like dental appointments doctor
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)18,ENFJ,appointments I would tend to do it while
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)19,ENFJ,I'm on vacation in the US or things like
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)20,ENFJ,that
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)21,ENFJ,but yeah this past week I was really
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)22,ENFJ,sick and not getting better after you
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)23,ENFJ,know many many days probably after about
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)24,ENFJ,14 days I was not feeling good so I said
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)25,ENFJ,okay we really have to go to the doctor
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)26,ENFJ,and see what is going on in case I need
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)27,ENFJ,like you know to get something taking
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)28,ENFJ,care of that serious or whatever so
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)29,ENFJ,finally I decided to go to the doctor I
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)30,ENFJ,do not like going to the doctor at all I
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)31,ENFJ,can just say that I do have a lot of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)32,ENFJ,anxiety around going to anything medical
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)33,ENFJ,and I also have a massive phobia of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)34,ENFJ,anything like about needles and blood
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)35,ENFJ,and that kind of stuff so I tend to
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)36,ENFJ,avoid it at all costs and I know it's
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)37,ENFJ,especially scary to go to the doctor in
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)38,ENFJ,a foreign country and I know a lot of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)39,ENFJ,you watching are in the process of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)40,ENFJ,moving to Switzerland or you're
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)41,ENFJ,interested in moving to Switzerland so
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)42,ENFJ,more than likely at some point you're
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)43,ENFJ,gonna need to go to the doctor and I
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)44,ENFJ,know it can be you know like I said it's
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)45,ENFJ,a little intimidating and scary cuz
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)46,ENFJ,you're in like a foreign place it's not
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)47,ENFJ,what you're used to and you don't know
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)48,ENFJ,what to expect
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)49,ENFJ,so hopefully with this video I can um
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)50,ENFJ,walk you through what happened to me so
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)51,ENFJ,maybe it gives you a better idea of what
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)52,ENFJ,might happen when you go to the doctor
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)53,ENFJ,okay so like I said I went to the doctor
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)54,ENFJ,three times this week so I'll try to
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)55,ENFJ,talk you through each of those
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)56,ENFJ,appointments so the first appointment
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)57,ENFJ,was my first time ever at this doctor so
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)58,ENFJ,I'm considered a new patient so there's
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)59,ENFJ,a little bit more involved in that first
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)60,ENFJ,appointment so basically we walk into
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)61,ENFJ,the office it's what's called like a
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)62,ENFJ,group practice like because of the type
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)63,ENFJ,of insurance that we have I think it's
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)64,ENFJ,called like HMO we have to go to this
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)65,ENFJ,specific doctor's office we can't go to
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)66,ENFJ,any doctor that we want based on our
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)67,ENFJ,insurance you can choose plans like that
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)68,ENFJ,where you can go anywhere but they're
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)69,ENFJ,more expensive so we went to this
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)70,ENFJ,practice and walk
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)71,ENFJ,and the guy at the reception just asked
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)72,ENFJ,for our insurance information and that
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)73,ENFJ,was it really he just asked for that and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)74,ENFJ,here in Switzerland the insurance cards
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)75,ENFJ,have like the tip on them similar to
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)76,ENFJ,like your debit card it looks exactly
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)77,ENFJ,the same like the chip on your debit
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)78,ENFJ,card you have those on health insurance
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)79,ENFJ,cards here in the US we didn't ever have
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)80,ENFJ,anything like like that on our health
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)81,ENFJ,insurance cards it was just like a piece
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)82,ENFJ,of plastic with your policy and your
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)83,ENFJ,name and stuff but here there's like you
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)84,ENFJ,know a chip on it so obviously they can
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)85,ENFJ,scan that and get whatever data that
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)86,ENFJ,they need so he just looks at the card
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)87,ENFJ,scan that quickly and we sat down I was
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)88,ENFJ,kind of surprised that they didn't give
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)89,ENFJ,me a clipboard to fill out I feel like
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)90,ENFJ,if you go to the doctor in the US they
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)91,ENFJ,always give you like a clipboard where
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)92,ENFJ,you have to like fill out your medical
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)93,ENFJ,history and like all that kind of stuff
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)94,ENFJ,and I didn't get anything they're just
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)95,ENFJ,like okay we have the insurance you know
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)96,ENFJ,you can wait in the waiting room so we
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)97,ENFJ,waited for awhile in the waiting room
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)98,ENFJ,there were actually a good amount of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)99,ENFJ,people there and one thing that I
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)100,ENFJ,noticed in Switzerland so the waiting
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)101,ENFJ,room was actually a closed glass room
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)102,ENFJ,like it had a door on it and there were
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)103,ENFJ,quite a lot of people in there and every
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)104,ENFJ,time some of you would come in like they
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)105,ENFJ,would greet everybody which was kind of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)106,ENFJ,strange to me so somebody would walk in
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)107,ENFJ,and be like could you see and everyone
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)108,ENFJ,would be like hallo could see though
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)109,ENFJ,like that like everyone was greeting
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)110,ENFJ,each other whenever somebody went and or
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)111,ENFJ,sometimes when people left they would
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)112,ENFJ,even say like goodbye and stuff so it
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)113,ENFJ,was kind of different interaction I
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)114,ENFJ,guess people were really kind of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)115,ENFJ,engaging with each other and that did
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)116,ENFJ,happen every time I went so I guess
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)117,ENFJ,that's kind of a cultural norm here to
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)118,ENFJ,greet the people sitting in the waiting
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)119,ENFJ,room with you and I guess since it's
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)120,ENFJ,like a closed room it feels a little bit
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)121,ENFJ,more normal to do that so we waited and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)122,ENFJ,then I got called to go in so in the
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)123,ENFJ,u.s. how it normally worked is if you're
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)124,ENFJ,waiting in a waiting room a nurse or
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)125,ENFJ,like an assistant of some sort will come
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)126,ENFJ,out and be like Sarah and then you know
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)127,ENFJ,you walk back you get put in the empty
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)128,ENFJ,room they might check a few things the
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)129,ENFJ,nurse or the assistant and then usually
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)130,ENFJ,you wait in the room for quite a while
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)131,ENFJ,for the doctor that's my experience
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)132,ENFJ,going to the doctor and here was not
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)133,ENFJ,like that at all so actually I was just
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)134,ENFJ,waiting in the waiting room and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)135,ENFJ,first of all they don't call you by your
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)136,ENFJ,first name here like I think in the US
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)137,ENFJ,they always said Sarah but here they
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)138,ENFJ,said found nor spit out Knorr so they
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)139,ENFJ,called me by my last name and then like
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)140,ENFJ,they shook my hand and that was actually
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)141,ENFJ,the doctor so the actual doctor she came
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)142,ENFJ,and got me from the waiting room and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)143,ENFJ,took me directly to her office so
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)144,ENFJ,there's no waiting like she just came
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)145,ENFJ,and got me when she was ready I guess
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)146,ENFJ,and then I went in her office and I wish
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)147,ENFJ,I had a picture um I didn't really want
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)148,ENFJ,to take pictures of that but you know
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)149,ENFJ,whatever obviously but it was very
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)150,ENFJ,different than like in the u.s. I found
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)151,ENFJ,that they're usually very small rooms
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)152,ENFJ,typically no window and usually you sit
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)153,ENFJ,on a like a bed that's covered in paper
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)154,ENFJ,but here the room was very large it had
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)155,ENFJ,a ton of windows obviously that's a huge
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)156,ENFJ,plus and there was like a bed that you
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)157,ENFJ,lay on but like there was no paper or
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)158,ENFJ,plastic or anything on it so I figured
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)159,ENFJ,I'm supposed to sit in the chairs
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)160,ENFJ,because over to the other side of the
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)161,ENFJ,room there was like a big desk with on
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)162,ENFJ,like three chairs on one side and then
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)163,ENFJ,one chair obviously for the doctor and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)164,ENFJ,like a computer and all that kind of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)165,ENFJ,stuff so she brought me in and then like
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)166,ENFJ,we sat down at her desk it felt kind of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)167,ENFJ,like you know when you go to the bank
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)168,ENFJ,and you're like sitting it like with
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)169,ENFJ,somebody telling them information and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)170,ENFJ,they're typing it in it was similar to
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)171,ENFJ,that because we sat down and then that's
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)172,ENFJ,where she actually asked me about my
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)173,ENFJ,medical history so the doctor was
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)174,ENFJ,actually the one asking allergies like
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)175,ENFJ,have you had this have you had that do
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)176,ENFJ,you have a family history of this on the
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)177,ENFJ,things that I'm used to filling out like
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)178,ENFJ,on a form she just asked me everything
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)179,ENFJ,and was typing it in as we went along
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)180,ENFJ,so we basically answered all those
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)181,ENFJ,questions got that out of the way and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)182,ENFJ,then she said okay so what brings you in
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)183,ENFJ,today and I told her you know I was
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)184,ENFJ,having really severe ear and throat pain
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)185,ENFJ,for two weeks that wasn't going away and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)186,ENFJ,then she said okay like let's take a
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)187,ENFJ,look so she pulled you know paper over
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)188,ENFJ,like the the bed thing and I went in sat
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)189,ENFJ,on there and she just looked in my ears
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)190,ENFJ,and a my throat and all that kind of
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)191,ENFJ,stuff and she could see that it was
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)192,ENFJ,infected but yeah I'm not a medical
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)193,ENFJ,person but when you have infections they
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)194,ENFJ,can either be viral
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)195,ENFJ,bacterial and viral infections there's
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)196,ENFJ,nothing you can do to really make it go
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)197,ENFJ,away faster in terms of medicine and
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)198,ENFJ,that kind of stuff but if it is
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)199,ENFJ,bacterial that's when you need
ENFJ_Switzerland vs USA | Going to the doctor (my experience)200,ENFJ,antibiotics and she was unable to tell

ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically18,ENFJc,hundred thousand other ones that are
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically19,ENFJc,minor ones but these are our textures of
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically20,ENFJc,energy and a lot of yoga is based on
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically21,ENFJc,really clearing out and energizing these
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically22,ENFJc,chakras or balancing them out basically
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically23,ENFJc,now one of the main chakras that I'm
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically24,ENFJc,always working on as an infj as an
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically25,ENFJc,introvert as an individual on this
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically26,ENFJc,planet that is completely losing its
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically27,ENFJc,grounding we're basically killing the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically28,ENFJc,ground that we live on what is happening
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically29,ENFJc,is that we really need to focus or at
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically30,ENFJc,least I'm spending a lot of time my time
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically31,ENFJc,focused on the root chakra right I'm
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically32,ENFJc,really spending a lot of time grounding
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically33,ENFJc,myself doing yoga poses that are related
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically34,ENFJc,to the root chakra
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically35,ENFJc,it's called mooladhara and ul-adha ra
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically36,ENFJc,but if you want to google root chakra
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically37,ENFJc,you're obviously welcome to do that
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically38,ENFJc,which I will show up as well and there's
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically39,ENFJc,a lot of yoga asanas a lot of yoga poses
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically40,ENFJc,that will focus on that but in general
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically41,ENFJc,any kind of grounding anything that
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically42,ENFJc,you're grounding yourself to the earth
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically43,ENFJc,where you're walking in on the earth
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically44,ENFJc,also barefoot really helps being in
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically45,ENFJc,nature really house meditating if you're
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically46,ENFJc,meditating with your body body and that
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically47,ENFJc,really helps but the reason I wanted to
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically48,ENFJc,do this video particularly is that I'm
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically49,ENFJc,noticing this weird trend and spiritual
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically50,ENFJc,people that I really I really that

ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically68,ENFJc,ourselves into different dimensions a
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically69,ENFJc,lot about doing a lot of cool things
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically70,ENFJc,with their meditations once spiritual
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically71,ENFJc,people cannot discover that especially
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically72,ENFJc,if they're able to add into the mix
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically73,ENFJc,mushrooms or ayahuasca ceremonies or
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically74,ENFJc,some kind of hallucinogen like that or

ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically78,ENFJc,that there is this whole new dimensional
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically79,ENFJc,and realm around us that we're not privy
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically80,ENFJc,to
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically81,ENFJc,we can't even see it I'm sitting here
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically82,ENFJc,right now I'm in the physical world and
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically83,ENFJc,there's all this stuff going on around
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically84,ENFJc,me in the other dimensions in the other
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically85,ENFJc,color forms in the other sound forms
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically86,ENFJc,that I am NOT I can't access but as a
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically87,ENFJc,spiritual person or as a person that
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically88,ENFJc,kind of experiments with all that stuff
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically89,ENFJc,a lot of these individuals will discover
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically90,ENFJc,all these other realms all these other
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically91,ENFJc,places all these others other beings all
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically92,ENFJc,those things and all of a sudden you
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically93,ENFJc,realize that the physical realm that we
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically94,ENFJc,living is kind of quite boring and
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically95,ENFJc,actually really annoying because over
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically96,ENFJc,here in the physical realm you have to
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically97,ENFJc,focus on paying the bills you have to
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically98,ENFJc,focus on working in the corporate system
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically99,ENFJc,or in some kind of work making money and
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically100,ENFJc,you know cleaning your house and doing
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically101,ENFJc,laundry and all that stuff while you're
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically102,ENFJc,thinking to yourself Wow all this
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically103,ENFJc,amazing stuff exists in all these other
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically104,ENFJc,realms if I meditate I can access them
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically105,ENFJc,or if I do all these other things why am
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically106,ENFJc,i focusing on all of this shitty crappy
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically107,ENFJc,stuff in the real physical realm why
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically108,ENFJc,can't I just live all of my life in that
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically109,ENFJc,other room and so I noticed a lot of
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically110,ENFJc,spiritual people kind of pushing away
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically111,ENFJc,the physical realm or giving up on the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically112,ENFJc,physical realm not wanting to be in the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically113,ENFJc,physical realm
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically114,ENFJc,no I wanting to worry about bills are
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically115,ENFJc,taking care of themselves physically not
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically116,ENFJc,caring about food or water or hygiene or
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically117,ENFJc,anything about that and then just
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically118,ENFJc,focusing all of their time and energy on
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically119,ENFJc,that spiritual realm and I disconnect
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically120,ENFJc,obviously from the physical realm is
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically121,ENFJc,really causing a lot of unground
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically122,ENFJc,and a lot of no dissipation are we
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically123,ENFJc,getting away from your root chakra away
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically124,ENFJc,from all of that grounding that is
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically125,ENFJc,necessary for a human being to survive
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically126,ENFJc,on this planet so I noticed that not
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically127,ENFJc,only do a lot of spiritual people have
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically128,ENFJc,this imbalance in them but also what
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically129,ENFJc,happens is that they don't have enough
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically130,ENFJc,money to take care of their bills though
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically131,ENFJc,so they're you know they're they're
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically132,ENFJc,begging on the street
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically133,ENFJc,we call them backpackers you know
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically134,ENFJc,they're begging on the street
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically135,ENFJc,are they begging from locals in Asian
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically136,ENFJc,countries who are apparently who have no
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically137,ENFJc,money at all and that makes me really
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically138,ENFJc,laugh or you know they don't have money
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically139,ENFJc,so they're kind of begging from their
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically140,ENFJc,friends like you know can you let me
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically141,ENFJc,stay for free or can you pay for my
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically142,ENFJc,bills or things like that or they're
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically143,ENFJc,finding someone who can pay for their
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically144,ENFJc,bills I could sugar daddy or sugar mama
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically145,ENFJc,or things like that and so I noticed
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically146,ENFJc,that there's this disconnect there they
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically147,ENFJc,just want to be taken care of in the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically148,ENFJc,physical realm they don't want to be
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically149,ENFJc,worrying about it so that they can just
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically150,ENFJc,focus entirely on the spiritual realm a
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically151,ENFJc,lot of that a lot of them will kind of
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically152,ENFJc,move into an ashram and start doing all
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically153,ENFJc,that so that they don't have to worry
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically154,ENFJc,about the physical realm but I always
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically155,ENFJc,think to myself you know yeah you can go
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically156,ENFJc,away for a little bit you can leave the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically157,ENFJc,physical around perhaps for a few days
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically158,ENFJc,months maybe even a few years but
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically159,ENFJc,eventually I feel like you have to come
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically160,ENFJc,back to it because hah I just feel like
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically161,ENFJc,it's such an impossibility to completely
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically162,ENFJc,disappear and completely run away from
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically163,ENFJc,the physical realm I don't know if I
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically164,ENFJc,even want to do that I always say to
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically165,ENFJc,people I like living in the physical
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically166,ENFJc,realm I do spend a lot of my time
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically167,ENFJc,meditating and you know lucid dreaming
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically168,ENFJc,or triangle lucid dream I'm trying to do
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically169,ENFJc,all those things I love spending time in
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically170,ENFJc,those other realms and other dimensions
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically171,ENFJc,it's so much fun but I always love also
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically172,ENFJc,coming back into the physical realm and
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically173,ENFJc,using my senses and the touch touching a
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically174,ENFJc,beautiful fabric or eating a delicious
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically175,ENFJc,food a delicious piece of food or

ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically177,ENFJc,never had before are smelling beautiful
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically178,ENFJc,sense of Rose or jasmine or walking on
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically179,ENFJc,the earth on the ground in the beautiful
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically180,ENFJc,nature and noticing the trees and the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically181,ENFJc,flower is the beautiful flowers that are
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically182,ENFJc,in Chiangmai
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically183,ENFJc,I love it so I just love being in the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically184,ENFJc,physical realm and use
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically185,ENFJc,my physical senses and being alive here
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically186,ENFJc,yeah of course it's a little bit
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically187,ENFJc,annoying at times when I have to do
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically188,ENFJc,laundry when I rather be meditating or
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically189,ENFJc,when I have to work when I rather be you

ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically192,ENFJc,understand there there's a lot of
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically193,ENFJc,annoyances associated with being in the
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically194,ENFJc,physical realm but it is part and parcel
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically195,ENFJc,of what I believe is really about being
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically196,ENFJc,a human it is yes for spiritual beings
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically197,ENFJc,and yes we are also physical beings but
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically198,ENFJc,we also have to kind of combine the two
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically199,ENFJc,and become the perfect version of both I
ENFJc_Balance Out The Physical And Spiritual Realms To Live More Holistically200,ENFJc,think it's not just possible I believe

ESFJc_A Video For Introverts0,ESFJc,Throughout my entire life I could count my close friends on one hand.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts1,ESFJc,"In fact, I don't think that number has ever reached three."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts2,ESFJc,A lot of people have the wrong idea about
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts3,ESFJc,introverts and I say that because for a very long time I had the wrong idea about introverts and so I
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts4,ESFJc,just want to share my perspective.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts5,ESFJc,It's really easy to look up the word introvert and see that the definition is someone who is shy or quiet.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts6,ESFJc,"Obviously, I'm not going to say that that's flat-out wrong."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts7,ESFJc,"It's in the dictionary after all, but unfortunately, I feel like things are not so black and white."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts8,ESFJc,I know it sounds crazy
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts9,ESFJc,but I didn't realize how introverted I am until very recently. And I think this is an
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts10,ESFJc,unbelievably valuable thing to know about yourself whether you're introverted or not. I'm just gonna speak for myself here.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts11,ESFJc,"Understanding who I am and, more crucially, how I operate has been a very confusing but important process for me."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts12,ESFJc,I feel like as I figure these things out little by little I've been able to make better decisions
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts13,ESFJc,"for myself and where I want to put my time. At my age, it feels like there's a lot of social pressure"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts14,ESFJc,"to be a partying and sexually active like 21 year old, you know."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts15,ESFJc,I think of movies like American Pie. And it's so backwards because even just a couple generations ago things were so different.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts16,ESFJc,"Now, however, that seems kind of like the image of happiness that we all see on social media and also mainstream media."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts17,ESFJc,I explored this a lot during my 30 days without alcohol.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts18,ESFJc,And that's a separate video
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts19,ESFJc,But I think the point of why I'm bringing this up is because I think there are other ways
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts20,ESFJc,to squeeze the juice out of life in your twenties.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts21,ESFJc,And I know that me saying I'm an introvert is going to surprise some of you guys because like I'm not socially awkward.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts22,ESFJc,I don't have a problem speaking to the camera.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts23,ESFJc,Speaking in front of people. Speaking with people. I can be really loud.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts24,ESFJc,I mean I love connecting with people.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts25,ESFJc,"That's the whole reason why I'm doing this, you know human interactions fascinate me"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts26,ESFJc,but above all I think that the most
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts27,ESFJc,"important relationship that you have in life is with yourself. For me, everything fits into three categories."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts28,ESFJc,"Very close deep relationships. These kinds of relationships feed me, and my creativity."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts29,ESFJc,Finding people that I can connect with on or even close to this level is really difficult though and doesn't happen very often.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts30,ESFJc,"In fact, I've never met somebody that I can fully connect with creatively and spiritually."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts31,ESFJc,Superficial relationships
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts32,ESFJc,"These are people that you have surface level conversations with where basically nothing is being said, nothing of depth, I mean."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts33,ESFJc,"These kinds of relationships and interactions. Don't just drain me, um"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts34,ESFJc,after a while they fill me with desperation
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts35,ESFJc,I have this feeling of being trapped and wanting to escape I know that sounds very dramatic
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts36,ESFJc,But I can't really explain it beyond that. It's just one of the reasons why I have always hated
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts37,ESFJc,"amusement parks, malls, and clubs."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts38,ESFJc,"And finally, there's time alone."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts39,ESFJc,"I put this in the same category as like food, water,"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts40,ESFJc,"exercise, and sleep. Basically an absolute necessity"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts41,ESFJc,for me to
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts42,ESFJc,"Properly function as a human being and it's not just that, this is where I want to spend the majority of my time."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts43,ESFJc,There is so much for me to explore
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts44,ESFJc,within my own mind
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts45,ESFJc,"emotionally creatively, I mean I really do think about this a lot"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts46,ESFJc,I'm at the very dawn of my career still there's still so much for me to discover and I get excited
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts47,ESFJc,Just talking about it
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts48,ESFJc,and
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts49,ESFJc,When you get that excited about something why wouldn't you want to put all your time and energy into it now Carl Jung the famous?
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts50,ESFJc,Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst had some very interesting things to say about
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts51,ESFJc,"Introversion and extraversion. To start he said, ""What appears to be random behavior is actually the result of differences in the way people"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts52,ESFJc,"prefer to use their mental capacities."" To me"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts53,ESFJc,"that's a mind-blowing statement because it's so true, and yet it's so simply stated."
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts54,ESFJc,"He also said, ""Each person seems to be energized more by either the external world"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts55,ESFJc,"Extraversion, or the internal world, introversion; and I think that's the key right there"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts56,ESFJc,"Like I said, I don't see things as being so black-and-white"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts57,ESFJc,But I do believe that we all lean in one direction or another. I'm not sure if this has learned behavior
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts58,ESFJc,I feel like as a kid I was at least a little bit more extroverted and
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts59,ESFJc,"Maybe it depends on like the stage of life that you're at, you know if you're going through a period of introspection"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts60,ESFJc,Everyone in my immediate family is the exact same way
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts61,ESFJc,It's kind of hilarious
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts62,ESFJc,If you know or think that maybe you're an introvert
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts63,ESFJc,"Embrace it, there is no shame in choosing not to hang out with other people and do your own thing"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts64,ESFJc,Of course
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts65,ESFJc,This is kind of a fine line because in my opinion there is no
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts66,ESFJc,"excuse not to develop your social skills and your ability to communicate. Warren Buffett said, ""If you can't communicate,"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts67,ESFJc,it's like winking at a girl in the dark - nothing happens.
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts68,ESFJc,"You can have all the brainpower in the world,"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts69,ESFJc,but you have to be able to transmit it. And the transmission is
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts70,ESFJc,"communication."" That quote kind of makes me laugh because it's true"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts71,ESFJc,All I'm trying to say is that I don't think it's healthy to always be avoiding the things that make you uncomfortable
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts72,ESFJc,And that's an important distinction that I'm trying to make if you're invited to a party for example
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts73,ESFJc,But don't want to go try to figure out what the real reason for
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts74,ESFJc,This is it might just be that you don't want to hang out with people and you need time to recharge
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts75,ESFJc,"Which is totally fine, but it also might be the fact that you're actively avoiding people"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts76,ESFJc,And that's a totally different story
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts77,ESFJc,I'm definitely not an expert on any of this stuff
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts78,ESFJc,"But I believe that the only way to get better at communication is by doing it, by the way"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts79,ESFJc,I have my own issues with connecting with people. I also have awkward interactions but deeper than that
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts80,ESFJc,I feel like I'm often
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts81,ESFJc,disappointed by the people that I get to know more deeply as I get to know somebody on a deeper level I
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts82,ESFJc,Invariably get to know aspects of their character or their ethics or their emotional intelligence
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts83,ESFJc,That I don't align with right and that begins to turn me away from them. Now. There are a few solid takeaways from that
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts84,ESFJc,I think one diversity I think is really not a bad thing - nobody's perfect. They don't exist
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts85,ESFJc,Thank God actually and if they did why would they want to hang out with me another imperfect person?
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts86,ESFJc,I have a very close relationship with both my parents and my brother and
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts87,ESFJc,When I lived with them
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts88,ESFJc,We would fight all the time and disagree on a whole host of things down to stupid like how to properly load the dishwasher
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts89,ESFJc,"I'm not kidding. However, okay on the flip side, I think it is good to have high standards"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts90,ESFJc,I truly do believe that the five people that you spend the most time with
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts91,ESFJc,Really do have a major impact on you and what that means is that I can't give up if I stopped trying to meet people
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts92,ESFJc,"Altogether, I would I really would end up"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts93,ESFJc,Isolated so I signed up to a couple of art classes
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts94,ESFJc,"Basically, this ends up becoming kind of a balancing act and I'm definitely still figuring things out for myself either way"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts95,ESFJc,I think that my ability to communicate which I worked really hard at by the way
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts96,ESFJc,Might be one of the most valuable skills that I have and finally a lot of people ask me about loneliness
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts97,ESFJc,"Once again, and without trying to push things too far to the extreme"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts98,ESFJc,I do prefer to be alone than in bad company while this isn't like a major problem for me I do face
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts99,ESFJc,feelings of loneliness from time to time but the truth is like I feel like the path to getting to know yourself and
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts100,ESFJc,Introspection can be lonely sometimes I think that is a small price to pay for doing something that most people aren't willing to do
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts101,ESFJc,Which is to get to know yourself better. I
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts102,ESFJc,Wanted to make this video because I think introverts kind of a bad reputation of being socially awkward
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts103,ESFJc,timid reclusive and by extension
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts104,ESFJc,"boring, I mean"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts105,ESFJc,I thought that for a very long time maybe I'm biased about all this but I actually think that the world could use more
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts106,ESFJc,introversion right now
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts107,ESFJc,More time from all of us dedicated to getting to know ourselves
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts108,ESFJc,What do you think? If you enjoyed this video? There are a few ways that you can help support this project
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts109,ESFJc,"I have a patreon page where I upload bonus and exclusive content, and this helps me rely less on"
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts110,ESFJc,Sponsorships to keep all this going also if you follow me on instagram or sign up to my newsletter
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts111,ESFJc,There's a better chance of me reaching you again instead of being drowned out by the avalanche of content on youtube
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts112,ESFJc,Thank you for watching. I really appreciate your time and all the wonderful messages and comments that you send me
ESFJc_A Video For Introverts113,ESFJc,I don't even know what to say. I'm a lucky person to be able to do this

ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture26,ESTJ,little different it's going on topic I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture27,ESTJ,feel like a lot of people especially the
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture28,ESTJ,audience I've built over time might not
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture29,ESTJ,like but it's definitely something I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture30,ESTJ,think they need to hear and it's
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture31,ESTJ,something I definitely need to hear but
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture32,ESTJ,refused to for a long time so hopefully
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture33,ESTJ,this does educate some people today's
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture34,ESTJ,video is going to be on apologies or
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture35,ESTJ,more so unapologetic culture
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture36,ESTJ,unapologetic conservatism began around
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture37,ESTJ,the time of Donald Trump obviously I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture38,ESTJ,think a lot of people just decide it was
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture39,ESTJ,time for conservative unapologetic
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture40,ESTJ,movement people could be
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture41,ESTJ,unapologetically gay and have gay pride
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture42,ESTJ,people could be unapologetically black
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture43,ESTJ,and have BLM but naturally during the
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture44,ESTJ,time of Trump more people came out as
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture45,ESTJ,conservative and more people came out as
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture46,ESTJ,unapologetically right-wing which I 100%
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture47,ESTJ,support I think people have the right to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture48,ESTJ,express themselves to be proud of who
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture49,ESTJ,they are but at some point we have to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture50,ESTJ,ask ourselves when does unapologetic
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture51,ESTJ,culture get in the way of our morals
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture52,ESTJ,when do we become so obsessed with not
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture53,ESTJ,apologizing we forget to do the right
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture54,ESTJ,thing by almost fear that this
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture55,ESTJ,unapologetic culture is an excuse not to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture56,ESTJ,own up to her own mistakes
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture57,ESTJ,for example as everyone knows I deal
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture58,ESTJ,with mental illness on a daily basis
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture59,ESTJ,PTSD depression anxiety there have been
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture60,ESTJ,times
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture61,ESTJ,past where I've used my mental illness
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture62,ESTJ,as a crutch or an excuse to act out
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture63,ESTJ,inappropriately but I can't do that I'm
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture64,ESTJ,an adult I have to own up to my mistakes
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture65,ESTJ,I have to say I'm sorry for acting out
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture66,ESTJ,and apologize from inappropriate
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture67,ESTJ,behavior and what better examples than
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture68,ESTJ,my own mistakes I have been on YouTube
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture69,ESTJ,now for less than two years almost one
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture70,ESTJ,and a half years and I've definitely
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture71,ESTJ,built a certain type of audience and a
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture72,ESTJ,certain type of narrative I have noticed
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture73,ESTJ,recently that with the change of my
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture74,ESTJ,views and ideas and opinions people have
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture75,ESTJ,been kind of getting angry with me and
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture76,ESTJ,sort of questioning why I'm changing as
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture77,ESTJ,a human being which is odd because as
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture78,ESTJ,humans that's what we're supposed to do
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture79,ESTJ,oh I look back at my past behavior in
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture80,ESTJ,this past year and a half and what was
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture81,ESTJ,wrong with me I have definitely done and
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture82,ESTJ,said some questionable things that I'm
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture83,ESTJ,not sure where my actual beliefs or just
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture84,ESTJ,the need to build my own ego and a lot
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture85,ESTJ,of things what I did definitely played
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture86,ESTJ,into this unapologetic conservative
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture87,ESTJ,culture and it's not just issues with
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture88,ESTJ,the left its issues with myself in the
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture89,ESTJ,right wing its issues with things I've
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture90,ESTJ,said things I'm worn things I've done
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture91,ESTJ,the past that personally I don't think
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture92,ESTJ,applied to my own morals things that
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture93,ESTJ,I've said and done that don't apply to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture94,ESTJ,me spiritually I know a lot of people
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture95,ESTJ,are gonna be saying Ashton don't give in
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture96,ESTJ,to the left or apologize the left be a
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture97,ESTJ,true proud Patriot but this isn't about
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture98,ESTJ,the left is about personal morals that I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture99,ESTJ,have gone against this isn't about
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture100,ESTJ,apologizing to the left or making up
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture101,ESTJ,something for myself this is simply
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture102,ESTJ,about owning up to my mistakes and being
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture103,ESTJ,a mature adult about it but apologetic
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture104,ESTJ,behavior has allowed us to point the
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture105,ESTJ,finger at the other person not own up to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture106,ESTJ,our own mistakes and to me that's
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture107,ESTJ,extremely dangerous to both our
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture108,ESTJ,spiritual and mental growth as human
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture109,ESTJ,beings I am NOT a perfect person I have
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture110,ESTJ,emotional meltdowns I have acted out
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture111,ESTJ,emotionally and possibly I think the
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture112,ESTJ,best thing I can do for myself is to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture113,ESTJ,apologize learn from my mistakes and
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture114,ESTJ,become a better person and frankly these
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture115,ESTJ,past two years I have been involved to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture116,ESTJ,politics than YouTube I haven't been
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture117,ESTJ,very courageous or kind
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture118,ESTJ,I was so drowned out by the likes and
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture119,ESTJ,the retweets and the internet culture
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture120,ESTJ,and my own narrative I forgot what I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture121,ESTJ,really stood for allowed an ego
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture122,ESTJ,narrative to completely control where I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture123,ESTJ,was going in life such a high ego for
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture124,ESTJ,myself
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture125,ESTJ,I forgot where I was morally I allowed
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture126,ESTJ,myself to be led by an ego and not by
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture127,ESTJ,God it's so interesting to me about
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture128,ESTJ,Christian conservatives they say oh
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture129,ESTJ,don't apologize be unapologetic but
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture130,ESTJ,aren't you the same people who say that
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture131,ESTJ,it's your job to pray on your knees
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture132,ESTJ,every single day and ask God for
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture133,ESTJ,forgiveness and here's the thing yes you
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture134,ESTJ,should be unapologetic about who you are
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture135,ESTJ,as a person you she proud of who you are
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture136,ESTJ,but I wouldn't be proud of Who I am if I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture137,ESTJ,didn't learn from those mistakes I've
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture138,ESTJ,done in the past and apologize if I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture139,ESTJ,never learn to take responsibility for
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture140,ESTJ,my actions in the past how can I grow to
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture141,ESTJ,be the person I am today how could I be
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture142,ESTJ,unapologetically proud of Who I am right
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture143,ESTJ,now after learning from my mistakes it's
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture144,ESTJ,okay to not apologize for things you
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture145,ESTJ,haven't done wrong but if you morally
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture146,ESTJ,inside believe hey this is not okay what
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture147,ESTJ,am I doing with myself that is God
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture148,ESTJ,telling you you need to own up to it
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture149,ESTJ,apologize a lot of people say not
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture150,ESTJ,apologizing is what makes you strong but
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture151,ESTJ,what if I told you acknowledging what
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture152,ESTJ,you've done wrong and learning from it
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture153,ESTJ,makes you even stronger I just don't
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture154,ESTJ,want to live in a world without change
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture155,ESTJ,and growth and understanding that we're
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture156,ESTJ,all human and that we all make mistakes
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture157,ESTJ,and we can all change over time how can
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture158,ESTJ,we expect the world to forgive us for
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture159,ESTJ,our mistakes
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture160,ESTJ,if we don't apologize for them first I
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture161,ESTJ,have definitely made quite a few
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture162,ESTJ,mistakes in the past two years that I am
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture163,ESTJ,NOT proud of and I want to say I'm sorry
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture164,ESTJ,for that I'm sorry for not listening I'm
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture165,ESTJ,sorry for not being opened up to a
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture166,ESTJ,conversation I'm sorry for not being as
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture167,ESTJ,mature as I could be I'm sorry for
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture168,ESTJ,getting into useless drama I'm sorry for
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture169,ESTJ,not controlling my emotions and acting
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture170,ESTJ,impulsively most of all I'm sorry for
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture171,ESTJ,having such a high ego I didn't realize
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture172,ESTJ,this then hopefully that I do now I can
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture173,ESTJ,do something for the better I am NOT a
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture174,ESTJ,perfect human being we're not perfect
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture175,ESTJ,human beings but I definitely believe we
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture176,ESTJ,can learn from it and grow from it my
ESTJ_Unapologetic Culture177,ESTJ,name is Ashton god bless and be seeing

ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?3,ESTP,something that came up in this reading
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?4,ESTP,and it's all about the law of attraction
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?5,ESTP,as you guys know self-love is the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?6,ESTP,highest virtue I have many videos about
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?7,ESTP,self-love because it actually comes
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?8,ESTP,above unconditional love for others
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?9,ESTP,because once you've mastered the art of
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?10,ESTP,unconditional love for others it's up to
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?11,ESTP,you to balance that with self love and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?12,ESTP,to temper it so it's a judgment call
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?13,ESTP,that needs to be made in each individual
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?14,ESTP,situation and circumstance so the law of
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?15,ESTP,attraction responds to self love a lot
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?16,ESTP,when you exercise self-love you
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?17,ESTP,basically tell the universe I love
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?18,ESTP,myself and so should you so that's why
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?19,ESTP,little things that you can do throughout
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?20,ESTP,the day such as buy yourself flowers
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?21,ESTP,read a good book go see a comedy
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?22,ESTP,whatever you can do to reward yourself
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?23,ESTP,for your accomplishments Pat's on the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?24,ESTP,back controlling your thoughts self
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?25,ESTP,complimenting wow you know you really
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?26,ESTP,kicked butt in that business meeting
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?27,ESTP,good for you beat up that critical inner
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?28,ESTP,voice and get rid of it and replace it
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?29,ESTP,with complementing cuz that'll boost
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?30,ESTP,your personal power and your self-esteem
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?31,ESTP,throughout the day now dots and emotions
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?32,ESTP,are energy so you're also broadcasting a
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?33,ESTP,signal right I'm treating myself well so
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?34,ESTP,should the universe because I'm worth it
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?35,ESTP,so that is what you are setting your
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?36,ESTP,magnet to attract to yourself okay now
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?37,ESTP,here's why the other side asked me to
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?38,ESTP,make this video right what happens when
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?39,ESTP,that balance between unconditional love
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?40,ESTP,for others and self-love is out of
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?41,ESTP,balance it's uneven it's tilted too much
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?42,ESTP,towards unconditional love for others as
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?43,ESTP,opposed to self-love it's not being
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?44,ESTP,tempered with that judgment well let's
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?45,ESTP,start with certain situations shall we
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?46,ESTP,the martyr martyr syndrome the Bible has
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?47,ESTP,a lot about this doesn't it
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?48,ESTP,unconditional love for others service
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?49,ESTP,let me just bend over backwards and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?50,ESTP,forwards and be your servant because
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?51,ESTP,unconditional love for others is
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?52,ESTP,applauded good for you you're so
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?53,ESTP,selfless
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?54,ESTP,you're so selfless you really really
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?55,ESTP,help that person well that's great
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?56,ESTP,that's fantastic and we should be
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?57,ESTP,helping each other cuz my other videos
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?58,ESTP,are all about the collective
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?59,ESTP,consciousness and your life purpose and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?60,ESTP,speaking your truth and being who you're
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?61,ESTP,meant to be and helping others with your
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?62,ESTP,god-given gifts and talents right but
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?63,ESTP,when you take that too far and you
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?64,ESTP,extend yourself too much in trying to be
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?65,ESTP,the martyr in a family situation just
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?66,ESTP,like oh I'll do it I'll do it at your
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?67,ESTP,own expense what happens you adopt a
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?68,ESTP,victim mentality and you start wallowing
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?69,ESTP,in self-pity and you start saying poor
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?70,ESTP,me poor me poor me and that victim
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?71,ESTP,mentality completely robs you of your
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?72,ESTP,personal power personal powers gone out
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?73,ESTP,the window and then the law of
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?74,ESTP,attraction responds to that victim
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?75,ESTP,mentality oh yeah poor you and then you
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?76,ESTP,start attracting crap to yourself
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?77,ESTP,because you see yourself as a powerless
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?78,ESTP,victim and you just melt now what's the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?79,ESTP,opposite of that the opposite of that is
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?80,ESTP,gratitude what are you grateful for
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?81,ESTP,write down a list because then that
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?82,ESTP,triggers you know personal empowerment
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?83,ESTP,and feeling blessed and a sense of
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?84,ESTP,appreciation that the universe then
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?85,ESTP,responds to and starts bringing you more
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?86,ESTP,abundance because you're grateful for
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?87,ESTP,the abundance that it's brought on to
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?88,ESTP,your path so do you see how
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?89,ESTP,energetically the martyr system when you
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?90,ESTP,take it too far you end up demonstrating
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?91,ESTP,a lack of self-love and the universe
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?92,ESTP,responds to that lack of self-love and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?93,ESTP,the law of attraction is actually really
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?94,ESTP,sensitive to that virtue to be honest
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?95,ESTP,like with my ass every folks I totally
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?96,ESTP,caused it by drinking too much coffee
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?97,ESTP,and tea so
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?98,ESTP,karma was out of balance I brought this
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?99,ESTP,you know medical condition on myself I
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?100,ESTP,was like self-love I'm like running into
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?101,ESTP,you know the grocery store just like
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?102,ESTP,grabbing all these flowers so fun by
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?103,ESTP,myself flowers yay Christine because I
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?104,ESTP,know how the universe responds to
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?105,ESTP,decisions base and self love however
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?106,ESTP,small so I'm just saying I'll do like
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?107,ESTP,little tricks like that what I know I've
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?108,ESTP,attracted darkness to myself I'll turn
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?109,ESTP,it around with small acts of self-love
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?110,ESTP,that's how powerful it is it's like the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?111,ESTP,universe is this tracking device how
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?112,ESTP,much do you love yourself now I'm not
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?113,ESTP,asking you guys to be selfish but I'm
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?114,ESTP,just saying there's a balance between
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?115,ESTP,self-love and selfish also self-love
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?116,ESTP,isn't supported by society so call you
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?117,ESTP,selfish don't judge you
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?118,ESTP,maybe that's why it's the highest virtue
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?119,ESTP,because the hardest one to obtain and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?120,ESTP,actually stick to because you're kind of
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?121,ESTP,marching to the beat of your on drumming
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?122,ESTP,going your own way and risking judgment
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?123,ESTP,in the process oh you're not a good
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?124,ESTP,person you didn't do that it's like well
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?125,ESTP,decisions based and self-love are always
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?126,ESTP,supported by Universal energy to
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?127,ESTP,remember that so just make sure your
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?128,ESTP,decision is based in self-love but the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?129,ESTP,martyr the martyr syndrome is incorrect
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?130,ESTP,so please throw that out the window that
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?131,ESTP,whole I'm your servant I'm your slave
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?132,ESTP,thing no you're really not
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?133,ESTP,you're really no one servant you're
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?134,ESTP,really no one slave you know even how
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?135,ESTP,they made a video called
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?136,ESTP,are you rescuing your partner case in
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?137,ESTP,point the other side holds each
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?138,ESTP,individual accountable for their own
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?139,ESTP,life their own behavior their own
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?140,ESTP,happiness because they manifest and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?141,ESTP,create their own worlds so the if the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?142,ESTP,other sign is we'll leave these people
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?143,ESTP,accountable you have to hold them
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?144,ESTP,accountable so you end up enabling them
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?145,ESTP,you end up weakening them if you help
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?146,ESTP,somebody too much you you you know take
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?147,ESTP,away their personal power by doing stuff
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?148,ESTP,for them so you're you end up hurting
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?149,ESTP,yourself and others sometimes when you
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?150,ESTP,try to be the martyr so you know another
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?151,ESTP,thing is is people try to be the martyr
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?152,ESTP,at work I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?153,ESTP,are you just trying to show off is that
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?154,ESTP,coming from a place of eco and just
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?155,ESTP,trying to show up make sure your
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?156,ESTP,intentions are pure
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?157,ESTP,if you're offering to do something make
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?158,ESTP,sure your intentions are pure I'm just
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?159,ESTP,saying because you attract darkness to
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?160,ESTP,yourself that way too so yeah you know
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?161,ESTP,like the type-a personality where
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?162,ESTP,somebody when when I was in the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?163,ESTP,corporate world somebody took a cartoon
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?164,ESTP,and wrote Miss Pavlina does not take
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?165,ESTP,sick days and it was an image of a girl
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?166,ESTP,walking into work with an IV and they
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?167,ESTP,stuck it on my desk and they were making
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?168,ESTP,a statement about me being type-a and I
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?169,ESTP,was proud of it when I got that cartoon
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?170,ESTP,I was like yeah that's pretty it's
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?171,ESTP,pretty accurate that's pretty dead-on
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?172,ESTP,thank you ho ho ho
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?173,ESTP,and I actually ended up hanging that in
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?174,ESTP,my queue and now if somebody gave me
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?175,ESTP,that I'd be like don't tell me that
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?176,ESTP,about myself I don't want to know that I
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?177,ESTP,don't want to know that myself love is
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?178,ESTP,so weak that I won't take a sick day if
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?179,ESTP,I need one cuz you only attract darkness
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?180,ESTP,to yourself I'm not worth it I'm not
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?181,ESTP,worth it I'm not worth taking a sick day
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?182,ESTP,and potentially disappointing people and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?183,ESTP,potentially having my work pile up or
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?184,ESTP,having my co-workers cover for me and
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?185,ESTP,you know asking them to do stuff for me
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?186,ESTP,because I'm not worth it I'm not worth
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?187,ESTP,it you are worth it make those waves
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?188,ESTP,because it's so fun and you are
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?189,ESTP,attracting positive energy to your soul
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?190,ESTP,via the law of attraction if you do take
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?191,ESTP,that sick day because it's your truth if
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?192,ESTP,your truth is you're sick you're
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?193,ESTP,embracing your truth so you're so you're
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?194,ESTP,aligning yourself at the truth and the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?195,ESTP,light so being sick becomes your truth
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?196,ESTP,that's really what it is that's why the
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?197,ESTP,law of attraction rewards you so along
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?198,ESTP,those same lines another issue with this
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?199,ESTP,is just plain old people-pleasing and we
ESTP_Are You Too Selfless?200,ESTP,do this all the time why do we try to
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed0,ENFJc,"Hi!  it's like 4:30 a.m. right now,"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed1,ENFJc,And I can't sleep. I've been trying for the last while.
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed2,ENFJc,And I just have so many thoughts bouncing around inside my head
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed3,ENFJc,that I just can't sleep.
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed4,ENFJc,What's up bitches!
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed5,ENFJc,...which is a reoccurring thing with me!
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed6,ENFJc,usually I--I have a hard time sleeping
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed7,ENFJc,just 'cause I'm thinking about stuff
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed8,ENFJc,probably more than I should be
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed9,ENFJc,but I've had some thoughts bouncing around in my head that I kinda wanna talk about
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed10,ENFJc,that I've wanted to talk about for a while
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed11,ENFJc,"--I mean nothing serious, or anything, just"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed12,ENFJc,"stuff that... I used to do these things fairly often before, a year or two ago"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed13,ENFJc,Where I would just--if anything was in my head I would kind of just blurt it out
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed14,ENFJc,"in a video and just kinda chat to you guys. Which I miss, and I"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed15,ENFJc,I kinda dropped the ball on that stuff for a while and
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed16,ENFJc,some of the community aspect of the channel kinda lacks then
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed17,ENFJc,"when you don't do that, 'cause you dont have a real connection then."
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed18,ENFJc,"It's hard to connect when you're doing let's plays or any other type of video so,"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed19,ENFJc,It was another excuse to do another one of these types of videos!
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed20,ENFJc,Something that I-- I get asked
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed21,ENFJc,"every now and then lately is: if my channel is ""dying""?"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed22,ENFJc,or if...
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed23,ENFJc,like--
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed24,ENFJc,"Everyone--people saying stuff like ""Ohh you changed, you were so much"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed25,ENFJc,"better before, you had so much energy before--"" things like that"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed26,ENFJc,"and I mean, people are gonna say stuff all the time anyway"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed27,ENFJc,stuff like that to... any sort of youtuber
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed28,ENFJc,"um, but one that keeps happening is"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed29,ENFJc,"like-- ""is Jacksepticeye's channel DYING?"""
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed30,ENFJc,and--no! It's not (laughs)
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed31,ENFJc,"even if I stopped uploading, tomorrow"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed32,ENFJc,"for like a year, there would still be some residual views"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed33,ENFJc,coming in all the time.
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed34,ENFJc,"It's just so funny on youtube, it's either you're..."
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed35,ENFJc,"you're ""top of the game"" or you're ""dying"". (laughs)"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed36,ENFJc,"But, sometimes it kinda bothers me, because"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed37,ENFJc,"it seems like, some people on the channel, some people who watch the videos that I do"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed38,ENFJc,seem to care more about the numbers aspect of it more than I do.
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed39,ENFJc,I think the biggest factor to it is that... I just don't upload as much as I used to
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed40,ENFJc,"'cause I used to upload two videos, every day"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed41,ENFJc,"and that was all I could talk about, that's all I could do, because that was"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed42,ENFJc,my entire schedule. My whole life revolved around
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed43,ENFJc,"getting two videos out every day, to the point where"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed44,ENFJc,it started to like-- REALLY affect my day-to-day life?
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed45,ENFJc,'Cause I didn't even have time to go out and get groceries or anything
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed46,ENFJc,"Well, no, was it July? Yeah, July, I went to LA last year"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed47,ENFJc,"in July and I took a week off, re-evaluated what I wanted to do"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed48,ENFJc,and I tried to get some of my energy back?
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed49,ENFJc,"and, I came back and I decided, ""okay I'm doing one video a day,"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed50,ENFJc,"from now on,"" because two videos a day was just"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed51,ENFJc,"It was too much time, I had no time to do any of the projects I wanted to do"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed52,ENFJc,"I had no time to even hang out with some friends that I wanted to hang out with,"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed53,ENFJc,and if I missed a video I'd get really upset with myself.
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed54,ENFJc,"So, I'm just not pumping out the same quantity of videos anymore,"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed55,ENFJc,"uh, so obviously, like--"
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed56,ENFJc,the view count has just--halved
ENFJc_Gaming On Youtube Has Changed57,ENFJc,on the channel on a month-by-month

INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life0,INFJ,According to common sense media
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life1,INFJ,"50% of teens said that they feel addicted to their phones, meaning that only"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life2,INFJ,50% of teens are actually self-aware enough to know that they are.
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life3,INFJ,See I look I was one of them. If somebody logged up to me 10 days ago and asked
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life4,INFJ,Are you addicted to your phone?
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life5,INFJ,I would have said no
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life6,INFJ,"But recently I realized that I actually am. See, addictions are weird because they kind of..."
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life7,INFJ,"They happen over time, and so it's hard to see like the big picture or like"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life8,INFJ,Bigger habits that have started to happen because it's been so gradual
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life9,INFJ,"But yeah, I mean"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life10,INFJ,My phone was the last thing I looked at at night and the very first thing I looked at in the morning and often times
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life11,INFJ,For like an hour...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life12,INFJ,Both morning and night. And like throughout the day just on my phone if I had to guess probably I don't know three And a half hours each day
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life13,INFJ,I think that this whole revelation started to happen one one time I went and I looked at my YouTube watch history
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life14,INFJ,"For the day because I was like, you know"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life15,INFJ,I've been on YouTube a lot today and I did the math of how many minutes I
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life16,INFJ,Had been watching and it was like over two hours
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life17,INFJ,And I had no idea. It was like 30 videos or more...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life18,INFJ,I just kept counting and that is in addition to being on my phone doing other stuff throughout the day
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life19,INFJ,So who knows how long I was actually on my phone every single day
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life20,INFJ,But yeah
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life21,INFJ,It was the first thing I thought about when I woke up in the morning if I did not have my phone on my bedside
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life22,INFJ,(Inaudible)..I would get agitated. I mean that is an addiction
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life23,INFJ,But it was like the perfect storm because I...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life24,INFJ,Was losing sleep and getting really really tired throughout the day because I was on my phone so much throughout the day and at night
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life25,INFJ,that I...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life26,INFJ,Wasn't getting the proper hours of sleep and even if I was getting like seven hours of sleep
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life27,INFJ,"It was like I was going to sleep really late, you know, like 1:00 a.m"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life28,INFJ,Which I mean you're gonna be tired if you're going to sleep at 1:00 a.m
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life29,INFJ,"Even if you're waking up later, you're just gonna be tired throughout the day. That's how it always has been with me at least"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life30,INFJ,But I found that I was just getting really really agitated and just being in a bad mood throughout the day because
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life31,INFJ,Like the day just seemed so crazy short and I just felt like I couldn't really get
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life32,INFJ,anything done throughout the day it was because I was probably spending like four hours a day on my phone and it's not like just
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life33,INFJ,A block of time and that I'm not thinking about my phone after that is like throughout the day
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life34,INFJ,It's distracting me from things that I'm trying to get done
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life35,INFJ,It just really started to completely destroy me and my sleep schedule was terrible
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life36,INFJ,Like I basically just missed the entire morning
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life37,INFJ,And then this whole vicious cycle kept going where I felt like I was behind in my tasks I wanted to get done
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life38,INFJ,So I looked at my phone to procrastinate more and then I bla bla bla. I would stay up late and
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life39,INFJ,"Look at my phone, was total disaster. So one day I had"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life40,INFJ,Basically just reached my breaking point
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life41,INFJ,I had enough I could not do this one more day cuz I was starting to lose my mind
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life42,INFJ,So I basically just
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life43,INFJ,Honestly completely started to hate myself and uh I realized at that point that the habits that I had picked up over time
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life44,INFJ,Needed to completely stop immediately
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life45,INFJ,So all this is going on in my brain and then in the middle of one of my youtube addict binges
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life46,INFJ,I happen to pawn a video of a Navy SEAL
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life47,INFJ,Talking about why everybody should wake up at 4:30 a.m. They're good habits. Why would you not wake up at 4:30?
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life48,INFJ,"Well, what does this bring to you... waking up early?"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life49,INFJ,"You just get a jump on the day, because what are ya doing at night most of the time? Most the time at night"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life50,INFJ,You're not working on anything super productive and watching stupid YouTube videos
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life51,INFJ,Don't do that. Instead go to sleep and then wake up early and that is exactly
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life52,INFJ,the video that I needed
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life53,INFJ,To watch in order to break this habit. As soon as I see something that strikes a chord with me
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life54,INFJ,I am all in... I'm I'm doing it. So that same night
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life55,INFJ,I told myself I would do a few things differently that sadly
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life56,INFJ,"I knew we're gonna be very hard, but that I knew were going to help me immensely in the long run"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life57,INFJ,"The first thing was that I committed to charging my phone in another room, not right at my bedside..."
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life58,INFJ,The second thing was I forced myself to actually shut off my phone one hour before I laid down
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life59,INFJ,The third thing was I set a bedtime of 10:00 p.m
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life60,INFJ,And told myself I would lay down at 9:45... Number four when I woke up
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life61,INFJ,I was not going to turn on my phone for three hours.
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life62,INFJ,"This is a formula that I have been following for a week now and let me tell you,"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life63,INFJ,"It's gonna sound melodramatic, but it has literally changed my life. That first night it was"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life64,INFJ,Actually a little easier than I thought it was gonna be
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life65,INFJ,"Um, because I had put my phone in another room to charge"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life66,INFJ,Like I didn't feel that urge of
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life67,INFJ,Grabbing it at night
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life68,INFJ,It was just kind of hard to fall asleep that early because I was so used to going to sleep at like 1:00 a.m
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life69,INFJ,But I forced myself to go to sleep that early because I was determined to wake up at 5:00 a.m.... 4:30
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life70,INFJ,That wasn't.. that wasn't gonna happen. That seems a little too early. Honestly just instinctively that's kind of early but 5:00 a.m
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life71,INFJ,It was and but it was strange like when I woke up in the morning
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life72,INFJ,I did not feel the urge to look at my phone and I think.. I think the reason was it's stupid
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life73,INFJ,But the reason was there was an extra step. I couldn't just pick it up and swipe
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life74,INFJ,"I had to pick it up and actually physically turn it on, It was an extra step that was unusual for me"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life75,INFJ,So I didn't instinctively want to do it
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life76,INFJ,"So this went on for a week and it was surprisingly really really easy to break the habit, a habit that seemed"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life77,INFJ,Completely unbreakable... was broken in...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life78,INFJ,Less than a week like. If you can just get through that first night of putting your phone in another room shutting it off
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life79,INFJ,It gets so much easier and the new habits that you form are actually a lot of fun and way way more
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life80,INFJ,"Fulfilling like now I sit out here on the back porch for an hour or so, and I just read something"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life81,INFJ,I never felt like I had time to do because I was always behind on
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life82,INFJ,projects I was doing but I read an entire book in...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life83,INFJ,One week.. something that's unheard of for me.. and it just took a few simple actions to actually make it happen
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life84,INFJ,Let me tell you a week of forcing myself to put my phone away and wake up at 5:00 a.m
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life85,INFJ,Has had tremendous benefits... like I'm not even exaggerating
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life86,INFJ,My attention span is so much better
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life87,INFJ,I can remember stuff now like that's an actual side effect to phone addiction. You just can't remember stuff anymore
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life88,INFJ,I've exercised way more as well
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life89,INFJ,it's like the second thing that I do in the morning after I read and it's a great way of just getting it out of
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life90,INFJ,"The way because if you wait, you might not do it. My mood has also been dramatically better"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life91,INFJ,I mean even my wife Sarah has told me that I just seem like a happier person
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life92,INFJ,"Like sleep deprivation will destroy you. Also, the days just feel so much longer,"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life93,INFJ,I mean when you wake up and it's dark and then you watch the sun rise...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life94,INFJ,That's a lot of hours until the sun goes down. Like you're not wasting three hours when the Sun is up sleeping
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life95,INFJ,it doesn't seem like a lot but that extra three hours like...
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life96,INFJ,Changes everything about the day. I also just feel way more awake during the day. I don't get tired
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life97,INFJ,I used to be tired all the time. I'm not tired anymore
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life98,INFJ,"I barely ever yawn and it sounds dumb, but just sitting outside for like an hour and just looking at birds flying"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life99,INFJ,"You know, look just enjoy nature. The human brain was meant to do that"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life100,INFJ,Like just having a quiet slow morning when nobody else is awake
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life101,INFJ,It's one of the most rejuvenating things that I have ever done
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life102,INFJ,I also just get way more stuff done during the day because I don't feel like the day is running away from me
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life103,INFJ,I feel like I am in control of the day. It doesn't control me and throughout the day
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life104,INFJ,I don't feel like I want to grab my phone every five seconds because I started my day out on the right foot
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life105,INFJ,It's kind of like a game. How long can I go without looking at my phone? It's actually kind of fun
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life106,INFJ,Like I'm not telling you that you need to wake up at 5:00 a.m
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life107,INFJ,that that is the magic time but I'm just saying try and put your phone away at night. Try and wake up an
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life108,INFJ,"Hour and a half earlier than you wake up now if you wake up late, you know what I'm saying?"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life109,INFJ,Like I'm really trying not to exaggerate but it's hard not to seem like I'm exaggerating when I'm telling you
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life110,INFJ,Just how dramatic of a change it has been in just one week. I want you out there
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life111,INFJ,I want you to try this because you will be a happier person. You will be a nicer person. You'll be a way more effective..
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life112,INFJ,Person throughout the day. I guarantee it waking up at 5 a.m
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life113,INFJ,"Is changing my life and I can only encourage you if you feel the same way that I felt seven days ago, please"
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life114,INFJ,Change up your habits. Try this. It will make you a better person
INFJ_Waking up at 5AM is changing my life115,INFJ,"Alright. I have a lot of stuff I got to do like edit this video and put it out, (inaudible) talk to you later. Alright, bye"
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?0,ESTPc,I saw a post on Reddit the other day
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?1,ESTPc,which asked why don't you like John fish
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?2,ESTPc,it's kind of like when you hear two

ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?25,ESTPc,since I started on YouTube I've
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?26,ESTPc,struggled with the question of identity

ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?41,ESTPc,fit into any of these molds of creators
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?42,ESTPc,I post videos because I'm just trying to
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?43,ESTPc,figure out who I am and who I want to be

ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?55,ESTPc,superficial it scares me a little bit
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?56,ESTPc,because I see people judging me in the

ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?76,ESTPc,trying out or lessons that I've learned
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?77,ESTPc,or thoughts that I've been having I'm
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?78,ESTPc,not really an authority on anything what

ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?83,ESTPc,mold of you know a fun ironic College
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?84,ESTPc,youtuber it's because I'm not one you

ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?86,ESTPc,genius making novel discoveries it's
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?87,ESTPc,because I'm not one I mean if I don't
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?88,ESTPc,fit the mold of a self-help guru who has
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?89,ESTPc,an answer for every question it's
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?90,ESTPc,because I'm not one I'm a 19 year old
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?91,ESTPc,trying to figure out who I am who I want
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?92,ESTPc,to be and to be honest I don't have a
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?93,ESTPc,lot figured out I have tried a lot of
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?94,ESTPc,things and I've failed that a lot of
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?95,ESTPc,things and I will continue to try a lot
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?96,ESTPc,of things and I anticipate that I will
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?97,ESTPc,fail at most of those things when I
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?98,ESTPc,think about the past 12 months how many
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?99,ESTPc,different faces I've tried on how many
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?100,ESTPc,different types of videos I've made kind
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?101,ESTPc,of different phases of my life I've gone
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?102,ESTPc,through I mean it's crazy I've changed a
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?103,ESTPc,ton there have been really good
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?104,ESTPc,experiences and really bad experiences
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?105,ESTPc,but no matter what all of those
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?106,ESTPc,experiences have shaped me they've
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?107,ESTPc,helped me to mature to grow up and
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?108,ESTPc,everything I experienced now good or bad
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?109,ESTPc,continues to do the same so yeah I've
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?110,ESTPc,been arrogant
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?111,ESTPc,I've been superficial I've been
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?112,ESTPc,pseudo-scientific I mean all of that
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?113,ESTPc,hate it's true made a ton of mistakes
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?114,ESTPc,also help people in genuine with my
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?115,ESTPc,struggles and I've made some pretty cool
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?116,ESTPc,videos and I promise that I'm gonna
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?117,ESTPc,continue to do both the good and the bad
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?118,ESTPc,because I'm a human and I'm a teenager
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?119,ESTPc,and that's what we did but we also grow
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?120,ESTPc,up
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?121,ESTPc,and as I've changed over the years I
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?122,ESTPc,think it's mostly been for the better
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?123,ESTPc,and I still have a long ways to go like
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?124,ESTPc,a really long ways to go but I'm
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?125,ESTPc,starting to learn that it's not really
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?126,ESTPc,about the end point because I doubt I'll
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?127,ESTPc,ever be in a place where I'm fully happy
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?128,ESTPc,with who I am or where everyone is fully
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?129,ESTPc,happy with with who I am that's just not
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?130,ESTPc,feasible what I'm starting to learn is
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?131,ESTPc,that it's about the journey the journey
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?132,ESTPc,counts and that's why I'm making these
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?133,ESTPc,videos is so fun because I'm able to
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?134,ESTPc,kind of figure out where on that journey
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?135,ESTPc,I am and where I need to go from here
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?136,ESTPc,and sure sometimes I'm gonna make
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?137,ESTPc,mistakes hopefully I can correct them
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?138,ESTPc,and move forward
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?139,ESTPc,I've confidence it's all gonna work out
ESTPc_Why Do YOU Dislike John Fish?140,ESTPc,in the end so that's me and if you want

ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -0,ESTJc,Authenticity is a word that you hear
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -1,ESTJc,flying around self help circles and
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -2,ESTJc,psychology offices and
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -3,ESTJc,spiritual communities all the time.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -4,ESTJc,"I myself am leading an 
authenticity movement"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -5,ESTJc,But what the hell does that mean?
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -6,ESTJc,In this episode I'm going to tell you
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -7,ESTJc,"""How To Be Authentic"""
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -8,ESTJc,Something that is authentic is not copied.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -9,ESTJc,"It's genuine, it's real and it's true."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -10,ESTJc,As authenticity applies to a human beings
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -11,ESTJc,we must follow the reality that each
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -12,ESTJc,and every person comes into this life as a
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -13,ESTJc,unique expression of source consciousness.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -14,ESTJc,"This means, each person comes with"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -15,ESTJc,"a unique essence, like
an energetic signature"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -16,ESTJc,"and our unique purpose 
and unique thoughts"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -17,ESTJc,"and unique feelings 
and unique desires"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -18,ESTJc,"and unique needs 
and unique role within"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -19,ESTJc,"the greater universe is 
embedded in that essence."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -20,ESTJc,Our process of progression through this
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -21,ESTJc,"planet should be a 
process of unfolding."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -22,ESTJc,Kind of like when a flower blooms.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -23,ESTJc,So you can recognize each person
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -24,ESTJc,as if they are a lotus blossom.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -25,ESTJc,"Their unique essence 
which is encoded with"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -26,ESTJc,"their purpose and 
everything else that we"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -27,ESTJc,think has to do with authenticity
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -28,ESTJc,is like a pearl inside of that lotus.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -29,ESTJc,Now... if we are allowed to unfold
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -30,ESTJc,"it naturally opens, exposing that pearl"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -31,ESTJc,but the process of socialization
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -32,ESTJc,on planet earth does not go this way.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -33,ESTJc,If we allowed an unfolding
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -34,ESTJc,of the authentic aspect of each person
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -35,ESTJc,the parenting and socialization process
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -36,ESTJc,"would be a process of 
enabling a child to unfold."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -37,ESTJc,"If we did not interfere 
with this process"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -38,ESTJc,and simply met the unique needs
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -39,ESTJc,"of the unique child in front of us,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -40,ESTJc,it would naturally happen this way.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -41,ESTJc,"But we live in a world 
where the process"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -42,ESTJc,"of socialization and therefore parenting,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -43,ESTJc,"is quite often an impediment
to the process of unfolding."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -44,ESTJc,When we come into the world
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -45,ESTJc,people do not look at us as if
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -46,ESTJc,we are a lotus blossom
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -47,ESTJc,and like it's their job to help us unfold
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -48,ESTJc,so they can see the mystery and the magic
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -49,ESTJc,"and the present in the 
gift of what we are."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -50,ESTJc,Instead they look at us like we are
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -51,ESTJc,raw material that needs to be molded
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -52,ESTJc,Almost like we do not have
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -53,ESTJc,an innate essence and they know what's
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -54,ESTJc,"best for that person to become
so let's shape them into that."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -55,ESTJc,They tell us that certain things are
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -56,ESTJc,"acceptable and if we are those things,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -57,ESTJc,we will be good and be safe.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -58,ESTJc,And other things are unacceptable and
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -59,ESTJc,"if we do that, we will be bad and unsafe"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -60,ESTJc,So naturally all of these vulnerable
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -61,ESTJc,"aspects of us, anything that might be"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -62,ESTJc,"real about us, that might be unacceptable"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -63,ESTJc,have to be hidden from view.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -64,ESTJc,We begin a process of splitting ourselves.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -65,ESTJc,We put forward only the things about us
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -66,ESTJc,that make us loved and safe in the world
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -67,ESTJc,and the rest we keep hidden.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -68,ESTJc,"It is as if we will not 
let certain lotus"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -69,ESTJc,"petals open and 
therefore keep the"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -70,ESTJc,"pearl hidden so as 
to fit into the world,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -71,ESTJc,be loved and feel safe.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -72,ESTJc,"What this means that 
our personalities are"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -73,ESTJc,"in essence, totally fake."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -74,ESTJc,"Because the parts 
of you that you put"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -75,ESTJc,"forward to the world 
(your personality) -"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -76,ESTJc,"those are just the 
things that kept you"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -77,ESTJc,"the most safe and most 
accepted in the world."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -78,ESTJc,"And that changes 
based on whatever"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -79,ESTJc,"external condition, culture,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -80,ESTJc,"fill in the blank, you grew up in."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -81,ESTJc,"Our personalities are merely the 
part of us that we identified with"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -82,ESTJc,"or developed so as to 
stay safe and away from"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -83,ESTJc,"vulnerability in the 
specific situations"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -84,ESTJc,that we were raised in.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -85,ESTJc,"We suppress, reject, 
deny and disown"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -86,ESTJc,"the aspects that make us vulnerable
or get us disapproved of in the world."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -87,ESTJc,"By doing this, they become subconscious."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -88,ESTJc,They are buried outside of our awareness
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -89,ESTJc,and we do not know they even exist.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -90,ESTJc,"To understand more about this process,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -91,ESTJc,I encourage you to watch my video titled:
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -92,ESTJc,"""Fragmentation, The Worldwide Disease"""
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -93,ESTJc,We can only be authentic to the degree
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -94,ESTJc,that we currently know ourselves.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -95,ESTJc,"That's scary, it means we"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -96,ESTJc,can only be authentic to the
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -97,ESTJc,degree that we are self aware.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -98,ESTJc,"That's scary, because the majority of us"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -99,ESTJc,is suppressed into our subconscious
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -100,ESTJc,Long story short guys -
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -101,ESTJc,we are not very aware of ourselves.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -102,ESTJc,Most of us are basically copies.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -103,ESTJc,Copies of what we saw succeeding
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -104,ESTJc,in other people.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -105,ESTJc,"We are not genuine, not real and"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -106,ESTJc,do not reflect what is true at our core.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -107,ESTJc,Our commitment to unfolding usually
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -108,ESTJc,ends up being something that we have
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -109,ESTJc,to take charge of and allow to
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -110,ESTJc,happen in spite of the world.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -111,ESTJc,We end up having to sort through
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -112,ESTJc,illusion to find what is real about us.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -113,ESTJc,"The process of becoming authentic,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -114,ESTJc,"which is finding your essence again 
and following that and allowing it to"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -115,ESTJc,"be shared with the world is no 
different that the process of awakening."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -116,ESTJc,"And so, for the sake of awakening, 
I will give you some tips about"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -117,ESTJc,how to be authentic.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -118,ESTJc,"Step 1 .The simplest 
way to understand"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -119,ESTJc,"authenticity (aside from discovering 
your innate essence)"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -120,ESTJc,"is it's the conscious mending of
the incongruences between your"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -121,ESTJc,inner world and your outer world.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -122,ESTJc,"That means, whats on the inside is"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -123,ESTJc,"exactly the same as 
what's on the outside."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -124,ESTJc,This is the opposite of
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -125,ESTJc,the wolf in sheep's clothing.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -126,ESTJc,"I know that many of 
you have heard that."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -127,ESTJc,"So obviously, if there is a sheep that's"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -128,ESTJc,"in wolf's clothing, or a wolf that's"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -129,ESTJc,"in sheep's clothing, either way,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -130,ESTJc,"it's not authentic, because"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -131,ESTJc,what's on the inside is not a direct
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -132,ESTJc,reflection of what's on the outside.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -133,ESTJc,There are all kinds of inconguences
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -134,ESTJc,in the world when it comes to people.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -135,ESTJc,"For example, let's take a guy who"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -136,ESTJc,hates his work.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -137,ESTJc,On the inside he really wants
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -138,ESTJc,"to do something else, 
so you could say"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -139,ESTJc,that his external job does not match
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -140,ESTJc,his internal desires for what job
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -141,ESTJc,he wants to have.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -142,ESTJc,That's inauthentic.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -143,ESTJc,"When a person says 
they like someone or"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -144,ESTJc,"acts as if they do, 
when the truth is they"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -145,ESTJc,"hate them and want 
to be nowhere near"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -146,ESTJc,"them, this is inauthentic."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -147,ESTJc,"When a person says 
they are not artistic,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -148,ESTJc,"because they suppressed that
inside themselves long ago,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -149,ESTJc,this is not authentic.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -150,ESTJc,"When a person denied 
how they feel"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -151,ESTJc,"because they have 
learned certain feelings"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -152,ESTJc,"are not acceptable, 
this is not authentic."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -153,ESTJc,"When we care so 
much about seeing"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -154,ESTJc,"ourselves as good that 
we cannot admit to"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -155,ESTJc,"aspects within us 
that wouldn’t seem"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -156,ESTJc,"so good, we are inauthentic."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -157,ESTJc,"When we have two 
Facebook accounts,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -158,ESTJc,"one for the people 
we know from work"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -159,ESTJc,"and family and one 
for the things we are"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -160,ESTJc,"actually interested 
in that they would"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -161,ESTJc,"negatively judge us for,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -162,ESTJc,we are inauthentic.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -163,ESTJc,"When we are gay 
but we pretend to"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -164,ESTJc,"be straight, we are 
being inauthentic."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -165,ESTJc,"To be honest, our entire society"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -166,ESTJc,is based on pretenses.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -167,ESTJc,"But the time has 
come for this to end,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -168,ESTJc,"it is one of the greatest 
barriers to awakening."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -169,ESTJc,So the question to live by is:
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -170,ESTJc,"Is there any incongruence between 
my outer self and inner self?"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -171,ESTJc,2. It is a far bigger deal to not even
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -172,ESTJc,"admit to or not even 
realize, even worse,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -173,ESTJc,"that there is an 
incongruency between"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -174,ESTJc,your outer and inner world
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -175,ESTJc,then it is to just deliberately choose
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -176,ESTJc,to be inauthentic.
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -177,ESTJc,I would love if we lived in a world
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -178,ESTJc,"where 24 hours a day 
every person could"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -179,ESTJc,"be authentic, but let's just be honest -"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -180,ESTJc,"one of us can take that 
amount of honesty."
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -181,ESTJc,"And on top of that,"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -182,ESTJc,"the world is not set 
up for that, right?"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -183,ESTJc,"If you walk in to your 
boss today and say"
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -184,ESTJc,"""Look, I hate you - 
that's the reality!"""
ESTJc_How To Be Authentic - Teal Swan -185,ESTJc,"it's not going to go

ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 20,ENFJc,[Music]
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 21,ENFJc,so when you envision yourself when you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 22,ENFJc,envision yourself working as a
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 23,ENFJc,programmer for a big corporation it's
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 24,ENFJc,going to things are going to move slow
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 25,ENFJc,there's a lot of documentation you have
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 26,ENFJc,to do
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 27,ENFJc,there's Sox rules sarbanes-oxley you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 28,ENFJc,have to follow rules you have to write
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 29,ENFJc,documents you have to you'll have a
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 210,ENFJc,project manager and he'll tell you we
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 211,ENFJc,need this document in this document you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 212,ENFJc,need to test it you need to test this
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 213,ENFJc,before it goes into production they
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 214,ENFJc,actually use it there's a lot of stuff
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 215,ENFJc,okay so my point is learning programming
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 216,ENFJc,this is a big point I wanted to make
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 217,ENFJc,learning programming is actually kind of
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 218,ENFJc,easy learning a programming language
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 219,ENFJc,it's kind of easy if you learn how to
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 220,ENFJc,make a webpage and how to save data and
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 221,ENFJc,how to do logic and then save it to a
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 222,ENFJc,database and write reports if you learn
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 223,ENFJc,how to do that that's great you know how
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 224,ENFJc,to code the problem is every company you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 225,ENFJc,go to has a different problem so your
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 226,ENFJc,biggest challenge it's not learning how
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 227,ENFJc,to code it's figuring out what they want
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 228,ENFJc,you to code so it's always very strange
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 229,ENFJc,when I go into an interview they ask me
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 230,ENFJc,so many technical questions can you do
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 231,ENFJc,this do you remember that I sit there
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 232,ENFJc,and think yeah I know that I can google
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 233,ENFJc,that right my question is what is that
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 234,ENFJc,you want me to do how bad is your code
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 235,ENFJc,is your code good or is it bad
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 236,ENFJc,one of the biggest problems I've had in
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 237,ENFJc,my entire career or is bad code
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 238,ENFJc,I've walked into some places especially
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 239,ENFJc,as a contractor and they said here fix
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 240,ENFJc,this guess what it was a nightmare
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 241,ENFJc,the code was thousands of lines they
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 242,ENFJc,they didn't plan it out some bad
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 243,ENFJc,programmer or programmers who aren't
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 244,ENFJc,there anymore they coded and coded in
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 245,ENFJc,code and they made a function I saw a
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 246,ENFJc,"function once that was 2,500 lines long"
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 247,ENFJc,to get to the middle of it I had to
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 248,ENFJc,scroll in scroll and they said change
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 249,ENFJc,something in the middle of that that's
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 250,ENFJc,when programming sucks
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 251,ENFJc,when you have to deal with someone
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 252,ENFJc,else's bad
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 253,ENFJc,code and you have a deadline to do it
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 254,ENFJc,that's why when you interview for a job
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 255,ENFJc,you they aren't interviewing me when I
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 256,ENFJc,interview for a job they think they're
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 257,ENFJc,interviewing me but I'm actually
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 258,ENFJc,interviewing them I'm figuring out do I
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 259,ENFJc,want to work for you because I'll tell
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 260,ENFJc,you right now as a programmer especially
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 261,ENFJc,with experience I get emails every
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 262,ENFJc,single day asking me if I want to go
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 263,ENFJc,work somewhere else I get maybe one to
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 264,ENFJc,three to five emails a day I get tons of
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 265,ENFJc,emails but but I'm at a good place right
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 266,ENFJc,now
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 267,ENFJc,and I like where I'm at it's ten times
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 268,ENFJc,better than anywhere I've ever been so I
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 269,ENFJc,ignore those emails I don't care I only
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 270,ENFJc,pay attention to those emails if I was
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 271,ENFJc,upset about something or if I saw the
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 272,ENFJc,future was gonna be bad so my point is
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 273,ENFJc,if you become good and experienced
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 274,ENFJc,people will be knocking down your door
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 275,ENFJc,to get you it sounds great but that
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 276,ENFJc,doesn't necessarily mean going somewhere
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 277,ENFJc,else is a good thing I've left jobs that
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 278,ENFJc,were bad and jumped into jobs that were
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 279,ENFJc,worse worse I'm like oh man I thought I
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 280,ENFJc,had it bad now I've got a real bad and
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 281,ENFJc,it's all based on who your manager is
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 282,ENFJc,how the managers management style is how
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 283,ENFJc,difficult is the code to fix what kind
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 284,ENFJc,of architecture do they have how many
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 285,ENFJc,tables you could walk into place that
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 286,ENFJc,has ten tables that's easy to understand
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 287,ENFJc,"or 5,000 tables that's impossible to"
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 288,ENFJc,understand that's why you need to ask
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 289,ENFJc,questions in your interviews and I know
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 290,ENFJc,it's really difficult to actually find
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 291,ENFJc,out anything in an interview because you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 292,ENFJc,really when you start asking them
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 293,ENFJc,questions they don't really talk about
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 294,ENFJc,it they're like well I don't know what
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 295,ENFJc,kind of main princess you know they
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 296,ENFJc,don't they don't know where they don't
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 297,ENFJc,tell you anything so you you end up
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 298,ENFJc,interviewing but not here's another
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 299,ENFJc,thing when you're interviewing here's a
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2100,ENFJc,tip I hate I'm sorry that this is so
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2101,ENFJc,random because I could go on forever
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2102,ENFJc,about this but when you're interviewing
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2103,ENFJc,the feeling you get about those people
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2104,ENFJc,that's the you're right about that
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2105,ENFJc,feeling so if you're interviewing in one
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2106,ENFJc,guy's a jerk and you know oh he's the
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2107,ENFJc,Manager guess what you're right he
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2108,ENFJc,we'll be a jerk you got that feeling you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2109,ENFJc,get about that guy is usually on target
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2110,ENFJc,every time I've been hired for a job I'm
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2111,ENFJc,like man everyone's nice that one guy
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2112,ENFJc,seemed kind of kind of harsh though
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2113,ENFJc,guess what he's he was harsh all the
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2114,ENFJc,time
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2115,ENFJc,your intuition was right not saying that
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2116,ENFJc,you shouldn't take the job or anything
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2117,ENFJc,but your intuition is probably right so
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2118,ENFJc,it interviews to me are usually done
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2119,ENFJc,pretty poorly like I said they ask you a
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2120,ENFJc,bunch of technical questions and the
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2121,ENFJc,reality is my technical stuff is good
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2122,ENFJc,like I said learning programming is not
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2123,ENFJc,hard it's applying it in fixing your
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2124,ENFJc,code that may be impossible you know you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2125,ENFJc,may be replacing somebody that quit
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2126,ENFJc,because they were angry right why did
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2127,ENFJc,they quit why why are you why did you
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2128,ENFJc,come into that company why do they need
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2129,ENFJc,you so bad that's something you need to
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2130,ENFJc,know are you filling a job position the
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2131,ENFJc,money is good if you find a good company
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2132,ENFJc,here's the good news
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2133,ENFJc,the money is good you deuced it does
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2134,ENFJc,seem to max out at a certain amount when
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2135,ENFJc,you get into them if you're in the
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2136,ENFJc,Midwest and you have a good stable job
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2137,ENFJc,"and you're in the 80,000 90,000 100,000"
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2138,ENFJc,range if you're in that range you're not
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2139,ENFJc,probably gonna make a whole lot more
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2140,ENFJc,than that because it just that's just
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2141,ENFJc,the max because they're not gonna pay
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2142,ENFJc,more than hundred and ten hundred twenty
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2143,ENFJc,thousand in the Midwest I'm not talking
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2144,ENFJc,about Silicon Valley New York all that
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2145,ENFJc,stuff in the Midwest
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2146,ENFJc,you're gonna max out about in that close
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2147,ENFJc,to a hundred thousand as it as an
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2148,ENFJc,experienced program I started out at
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2149,ENFJc,"30,000 and my first my first raise was"
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2150,ENFJc,"like 4% and I got 33,000 and then after"
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2151,ENFJc,a year and a half I quit and moved to
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2152,ENFJc,Chicago from Tulsa and I went up to like
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2153,ENFJc,"50,000 and then my next job was like"
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2154,ENFJc,"65,000 that's how I moved within two or"
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2155,ENFJc,three years I started out got a little
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2156,ENFJc,experience quit and moved quit and moved
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2157,ENFJc,and then I became a contractor
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2158,ENFJc,consultant and then I made over a
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2159,ENFJc,hundred thousand for a long time
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2160,ENFJc,high-pressure working in Chicago was
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2161,ENFJc,very difficult I was a consultant so
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2162,ENFJc,they would send me across the city all
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2163,ENFJc,the time and so I was in lots of traffic
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2164,ENFJc,very stressful some of the people there
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2165,ENFJc,weren't so nice you know some of the
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2166,ENFJc,managers weren't so nice so you you will
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2167,ENFJc,get paid but you also pay for stress
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2168,ENFJc,anyway that's just an opener I wanted to
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2169,ENFJc,get that out there there's a million
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2170,ENFJc,more things I could tell you and I'm
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2171,ENFJc,going to add them to more videos but I
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2172,ENFJc,just wanted to get this out there this
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2173,ENFJc,is intro to programming this is what my
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2174,ENFJc,experience has been like it's it's been
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2175,ENFJc,it's paid off very well I mean I've been
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2176,ENFJc,doing this for 15 years so if it sounds
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2177,ENFJc,like I'm trying to discourage you I'm
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2178,ENFJc,trying to just tell you what the reality
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2179,ENFJc,is I'm not trying to discourage you I'm
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2180,ENFJc,telling you you can make a living at it
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2181,ENFJc,it can be good but you have to learn how
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2182,ENFJc,to deal with stress learn how to deal
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2183,ENFJc,with problems you cannot let one little
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2184,ENFJc,problem get you because I T is nothing
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2185,ENFJc,but problems every day something's
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2186,ENFJc,breaks every day something breaks
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2187,ENFJc,everything every day constantly you're
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2188,ENFJc,fixing problems that's what you do
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2189,ENFJc,you're fixing problems fixing you're
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2190,ENFJc,just fixing and fixing and fixing and
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2191,ENFJc,you can't take it personally you know at
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2192,ENFJc,first I would get so and when I was in
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2193,ENFJc,college I would get so angry like when I
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2194,ENFJc,get a problem I would get so mad like
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2195,ENFJc,man I can't do this then I realize wait
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2196,ENFJc,a minute this is how it's gonna be all
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2197,ENFJc,right I'm out I'll tell you more later
ENFJc_Programmer: Reality vs Expectations (Computer Programmer) Part 2198,ENFJc,you
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?0,INFJ,If you concentrate solely on your career you can get a long way in your career
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?1,INFJ,And I would say that that's a strategy that a minority of men
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?2,INFJ,Preferentially do that that's all they do they worked like 70 80 hours a week. They go flat out on their career
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?3,INFJ,They're staking everything on the small probability of exceptional status in a narrow domain
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?4,INFJ,But it's it's hard on them. They don't have a life. It's very difficult for them to have a family
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?5,INFJ,They don't know how to take any leisure activity like they get very one-dimensional now it may be that that
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?6,INFJ,Unidimensionality is the price you have to pay to be
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?7,INFJ,exceptional at one thing right because if you're going to be something like a genius level mathematician and you want to do that for a
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?8,INFJ,Scientist say it's like you're in your lab
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?9,INFJ,You're in your lab all the time you're working 70 hours a week or 80 hours a week you're smart
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?10,INFJ,You're dedicated you're unidimensional
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?11,INFJ,And that's how you get to beat all the other people who are doing that it's the only way
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?12,INFJ,"but the problem is you don't get a life now if you love being a scientist, and you have that kind of"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?13,INFJ,"focus of mind well first of all you're a rare person and second you're gonna pay for it, but fine, more power to you, but"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?14,INFJ,"But it's a it's a risky business to do that, you sacrifice a lot for it you know and I would say most"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?15,INFJ,Often if you're speaking about having a healthy life that isn't what you do you spread yourself out more
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?16,INFJ,So you know you have a family you have some things that you do outside of work that are meaningful to you and useful
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?17,INFJ,You you have a network of friends
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?18,INFJ,That that those three things alone are four things alone plenty to keep you well oriented
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?19,INFJ,And then if one of those things collapses you know
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?20,INFJ,Everything doesn't go
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?21,INFJ,Now the price you pay for that is the more you strive to optimize that balance the less likely you are to be
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?22,INFJ,"Fantastically successful at any single one of them, but you might have a very you know if you couldn't consider your life as a whole"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?23,INFJ,That might be a winning strategy one of the things Carl Jung said I really like this
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?24,INFJ,He thought that men went after perfection and women went after wholeness so they're different they're different
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?25,INFJ,"value, they're different. There's something different at the top of the value hierarchy so perfection would be"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?26,INFJ, 
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?27,INFJ,Stake it all on one thing and look for radical success not that all men do that because they don't but we're talking about extremes
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?28,INFJ,At least with regards to the men that do that the wholeness idea is more like well. I want I want
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?29,INFJ,It's like I want one thing in my life to be a hundred and fifty percent
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?30,INFJ,Or I want five things in my life to be 80 percent
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?31,INFJ,Well
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?32,INFJ,There there's a lot more richness in a life where you have five things operating at eighty percent
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?33,INFJ,But you're not operating in any of that any of them at a hundred and fifty percent
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?34,INFJ,so and I really believe this because I've watched men and women go through their careers now for a long period of time and one
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?35,INFJ,of the things that
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?36,INFJ,There's lots of things that produce this
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?37,INFJ,But one of the things that I've noticed is that mostly women in their 30s bail out of uni dimensional careers
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?38,INFJ,They won't do them. They won't they won't put in the 80 hours a week that they would have to put in in order to
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?39,INFJ,dominate that particular area
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?40,INFJ,and it isn't the reason that they won't do it is because they decide it's not worth it and no wonder because
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?41,INFJ,Why would that be worth it you have to ask yourself that it's like well you want to be an outstanding scientist
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?42,INFJ,It's like okay really really. That's what you want because that means that's what you do
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?43,INFJ,Because you're competing with other people you know they're smart
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?44,INFJ,They're hard-working
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?45,INFJ,And if you want to be at the top you have to be smarter and work harder than any of them and working hard means
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?46,INFJ,"Working long hours. I mean it also means working diligently, but in in the final analysis"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?47,INFJ,It's also an additive issue if I'm smart and hardworking and I can crank out for 70 hours a week
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?48,INFJ,And you do it for thirty it's like in two years. I'm so far ahead of you you will never ever catch up
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?49,INFJ,so
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?50,INFJ,"Anyways, and I think partly maybe part of the reason to that women are oriented that way more than men"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?51,INFJ,I think there's two reasons this one is
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?52,INFJ,Socioeconomic status does not make women more attractive on the mating market
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?53,INFJ,But it does make men more attractive and the second is women's time frame is compressed
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?54,INFJ,"Right because guys can always say well. I'll have kids later, and they can say that till they're like 80"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?55,INFJ,Whereas women it's like no way man. You got to get it
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?56,INFJ,"You got to get it together by the time your let's say 40, but really probably by 35"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?57,INFJ,But definitely by 40 because otherwise it ain't happening and that's bloody dreadful like the most unhappy people you ever see
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?58,INFJ,No
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?59,INFJ,No
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?60,INFJ,One of the common routes to extreme unhappiness is to want children and not have them
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?61,INFJ,I wouldn't recommend that
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?62,INFJ,You know you see couples who were in their 30s one couple in three over the age of 30 has fertility problems. That's defined as
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?63,INFJ,Inability to conceive after one year of trying one in three
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?64,INFJ,"So it's worth thinking about because people are very very unhappy if they want to have kids, and then they can't man"
INFJ_Jordan Peterson - Do You Want To Have A Life? Or Be Exceptional At One Thing?65,INFJ,You're in the medical mill for ten years if that's if that's what happens to you

INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders3,INFP,it is that I manage my staff let me tell
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders4,INFP,you the simple answer to how I manage my
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders5,INFP,staff is this I don't I don't manage my
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders6,INFP,staff I lead my staff you know there's
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders7,INFP,been this ongoing debate ongoing
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders8,INFP,argument over managers versus leaders
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders9,INFP,and what particular category that people
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders10,INFP,may fall into and some say after reading
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders11,INFP,countless books and being in a number of
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders12,INFP,different leadership roles in both
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders13,INFP,nonprofit organizations corporations and
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders14,INFP,worked in politics and in ministry I'm
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders15,INFP,tell you I've definitely witnessed the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders16,INFP,difference between the two and I had the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders17,INFP,opportunity as a young leader to work
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders18,INFP,for a meeting a gentleman who was a
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders19,INFP,great leader I mean he was the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders20,INFP,consummate leader and his name was
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders21,INFP,Marvin Weaver he taught me some of the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders22,INFP,best leadership principles and I really
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders23,INFP,summed them to this acronym that I
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders24,INFP,called back and he again was the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders25,INFP,consummate leader and so as I'm sitting
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders26,INFP,here thinking about Marvel a did the B
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders27,INFP,for back it's becc but the B was
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders28,INFP,believed I mean he always believed in me
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders29,INFP,he believed in me he believed in others
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders30,INFP,and I'm saying the E was he encouraged
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders31,INFP,me he encouraged me to to be more to do
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders32,INFP,more he was always an encourage the C
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders33,INFP,was is he challenged me he challenged me
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders34,INFP,to dream big to think bigger to do more
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders35,INFP,he challenged me spiritually child me
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders36,INFP,professionally and the last C probably
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders37,INFP,the most important is he corrected me I
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders38,INFP,mean if I got a little bit off balance
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders39,INFP,he always would correct me and bring me
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders40,INFP,back in line and I would say as we as we
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders41,INFP,look at leaders and managers both have
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders42,INFP,their role but in in their simplest form
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders43,INFP,here's a deal
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders44,INFP,leaders develop followers and managers
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders45,INFP,manage people and things and so leaders
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders46,INFP,don't have subordinates because they're
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders47,INFP,in the business again of developing
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders48,INFP,followers in the business developing
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders49,INFP,other leaders or managers on the other
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders50,INFP,hand they have to have some boards it's
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders51,INFP,all about positional equity and telling
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders52,INFP,subordinate Joe or subordinate Sally to
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders53,INFP,go make this widget and make it in this
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders54,INFP,way a leader on the other hand they're
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders55,INFP,not worried about some positional equity
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders56,INFP,or some formal Authority
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders57,INFP,because they know that they're in the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders58,INFP,business of creating a tribe and
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders59,INFP,developing more leaders and what we have
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders60,INFP,to understand is that the business of
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders61,INFP,following it's voluntary
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders62,INFP,it's a voluntary action out of times
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders63,INFP,managers don't even realize this and so
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders64,INFP,the challenge for most managers they
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders65,INFP,don't realize that they're managing that
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders66,INFP,they're confusing managing with
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders67,INFP,leadership and so I'm going to look at
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders68,INFP,helped us to look at these 10 simple
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders69,INFP,category principles and category
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders70,INFP,comparisons that will compare the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders71,INFP,difference between a manager and leader
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders72,INFP,and so the first thing when it comes to
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders73,INFP,essence the essence of all of this
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders74,INFP,managers they're all about stability
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders75,INFP,we're a leader on the other hand they're
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders76,INFP,all about change you know when it comes
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders77,INFP,to rules managers make the rules leaders
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders78,INFP,they break the rules you know for the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders79,INFP,sake of their organization for the sake
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders80,INFP,of what they're leading when it comes to
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders81,INFP,approach you know it's all about for man
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders82,INFP,is all about planning the details we're
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders83,INFP,a leader it's about setting the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders84,INFP,direction this is where we're going and
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders85,INFP,when it comes to culture managers they
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders86,INFP,execute and we're leaders they shape the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders87,INFP,culture when it comes to conflict
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders88,INFP,managers oftentimes avoid conflict we're
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders89,INFP,leaders they use conflict as an asset
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders90,INFP,because they understand that there's no
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders91,INFP,movement without friction when it comes
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders92,INFP,to direction and managers like to go
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders93,INFP,down the existing road I'm going to go
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders94,INFP,this way this is comfortable where
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders95,INFP,leaders they like to go down new roads
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders96,INFP,when it comes to credit man managers
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders97,INFP,tend to take credit where leaders they
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders98,INFP,give credit to all those around those
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders99,INFP,who are making it happen
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders100,INFP,when it comes to decisions managers
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders101,INFP,makes the decisions where leaders would
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders102,INFP,generally facilitate the decision they
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders103,INFP,will encourage and create buy-in in a
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders104,INFP,healthy way when it comes to vision
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders105,INFP,managers tail and leaders they sell they
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders106,INFP,sell the vision and direction and this
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders107,INFP,one is really important the last one
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders108,INFP,number 10 when it comes to style
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders109,INFP,managers are generally transactional and
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders110,INFP,what are the transactions to get this
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders111,INFP,from there where are leaders
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders112,INFP,it's about being transformational
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders113,INFP,transforming people transform the
INFP_Top 10 Differences Between Managers and Leaders114,INFP,organization transforming a culture let

INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.0,INTJ,I guess what's up I'm Andy I'm a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.1,INTJ,self-taught software developer and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.2,INTJ,today's video is all about JavaScript
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.3,INTJ,it's a JavaScript primer video and what
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.4,INTJ,I mean by primer is we're going to take
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.5,INTJ,"a 10,000 foot view of JavaScript explain"
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.6,INTJ,what it is
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.7,INTJ,where you can find it what other
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.8,INTJ,software development community thinks
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.9,INTJ,about it and maybe why you should learn
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.10,INTJ,it I've had a lot of people ask
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.11,INTJ,questions about specific programming
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.12,INTJ,languages in previous videos and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.13,INTJ,comments so I figured why not take some
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.14,INTJ,time to give sort of a overview of each
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.15,INTJ,programming language and so I'm creating
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.16,INTJ,this primer series now the ideal person
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.17,INTJ,you watch this is somebody who's just
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.18,INTJ,starting out who's a beginner who's
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.19,INTJ,brand-new to sort of software
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.20,INTJ,development or web development in
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.21,INTJ,general and that way I can kind of guide
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.22,INTJ,you sort of just tell you a little bit
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.23,INTJ,about what JavaScript does and maybe how
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.24,INTJ,it fits in all these sort of development
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.25,INTJ,software development universe all right
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.26,INTJ,so let's just get right into it
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.27,INTJ,what is JavaScript well why should we
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.28,INTJ,start here start with the Internet
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.29,INTJ,so JavaScript has been called the
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.30,INTJ,language of the web and the reason it's
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.31,INTJ,called the language of the web is
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.32,INTJ,because pretty much everywhere you go
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.33,INTJ,every website you visit will use
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.34,INTJ,JavaScript in some sort of meaningful
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.35,INTJ,way to make that web page dynamic let's
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.36,INTJ,take a very typical scenario of where
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.37,INTJ,you're going to your favorite website
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.38,INTJ,maybe it's I don't know and Easter quits
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.39,INTJ,calm or something like that but each
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.40,INTJ,website will serve up a few files but
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.41,INTJ,let's say it's a very basic scenario
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.42,INTJ,your your website's gonna serve up in
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.43,INTJ,index.html page and a script ideas page
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.44,INTJ,now the index up to HTML page is serving
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.45,INTJ,up basically HTML to the browser and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.46,INTJ,HTML stands for hypertext markup
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.47,INTJ,language which just essentially means
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.48,INTJ,it's the it's telling the browser it's
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.49,INTJ,like the skeleton of the page right it's
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.50,INTJ,gonna tell the browser where to place
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.51,INTJ,different items it's gonna tell the
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.52,INTJ,browser what to show in terms of initial
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.53,INTJ,data in other words maybe it's got a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.54,INTJ,title it's got a body paragraph etc etc
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.55,INTJ,but that HTML page is very limited in
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.56,INTJ,what it can do because it can really
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.57,INTJ,only show static meaning never changing
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.58,INTJ,day
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.59,INTJ,now by itself obviously that HTML page
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.60,INTJ,is nice and all you can show people with
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.61,INTJ,some information but by itself it's
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.62,INTJ,pretty limited in what it can do
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.63,INTJ,so say you wanted to grab information
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.64,INTJ,from a server say you wanted to grab
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.65,INTJ,information from Twitter and display
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.66,INTJ,some tweets some live tweets on your web
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.67,INTJ,page you can't do that alone with HTML
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.68,INTJ,like that doesn't have the built-in
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.69,INTJ,functionality to go out and do that
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.70,INTJ,that's where JavaScript JavaScript can
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.71,INTJ,come into play it can turn your static
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.72,INTJ,website your static HTML site into a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.73,INTJ,dynamic site javascript is actually able
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.74,INTJ,to manipulate what is you are looking at
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.75,INTJ,on the website but being able to access
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.76,INTJ,the HTML Dom which is the document
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.77,INTJ,object model which basically is the
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.78,INTJ,programmatic sort of data that tells
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.79,INTJ,JavaScript what is not only on the page
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.80,INTJ,where it's currently the page looks like
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.81,INTJ,but it gives it access to change things
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.82,INTJ,on the page now that information that
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.83,INTJ,Dom information is available through an
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.84,INTJ,API which stands for application
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.85,INTJ,programming interface now really don't
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.86,INTJ,need to know what an API is other than
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.87,INTJ,it's sort of the opening to control some
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.88,INTJ,of the the things on the HTML page again
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.89,INTJ,that's something that you'll probably
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.90,INTJ,learn more when you actually decide
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.91,INTJ,you're gonna learn JavaScript beyond
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.92,INTJ,that javascript has loads of potential
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.93,INTJ,function I that you can use with it so
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.94,INTJ,in the example that I used the for
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.95,INTJ,accessing Twitter not only can you
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.96,INTJ,potentially access Twitter
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.97,INTJ,programmatically meaning if you you can
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.98,INTJ,connect to their API their application
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.99,INTJ,programming interface and access tweets
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.100,INTJ,directly you can also access a server
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.101,INTJ,that you are running where you can send
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.102,INTJ,it some information and it could send
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.103,INTJ,you information back and the work to
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.104,INTJ,connect to Twitter or whatever outside
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.105,INTJ,sort of data service that you need it
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.106,INTJ,can do the work server-side and return
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.107,INTJ,it to JavaScript but javascript has that
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.108,INTJ,functionality in it to sort of access
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.109,INTJ,web services process information it's
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.110,INTJ,really limited to your creativity of
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.111,INTJ,what you want to do with that you can
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.112,INTJ,even create a video game like I did for
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.113,INTJ,my first step which is
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.114,INTJ,here all right so we know that
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.115,INTJ,javascript is used to help make HTML
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.116,INTJ,pages dynamic but where else is it used
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.117,INTJ,it does not limit it to the browser
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.118,INTJ,there are so many places that's use now
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.119,INTJ,there's really a massive JavaScript
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.120,INTJ,universe the first place that most
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.121,INTJ,people who work with JavaScript may be
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.122,INTJ,familiar with is the area of web
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.123,INTJ,frameworks now web frameworks built with
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.124,INTJ,JavaScript are so common nowadays that
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.125,INTJ,the running joke is that there's a new
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.126,INTJ,sort of framework available every day
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.127,INTJ,and it's true there are tons of
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.128,INTJ,JavaScript frameworks it might have
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.129,INTJ,heard of angularjs react j/s backbone
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.130,INTJ,view is another one that's fairly recent
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.131,INTJ,and plenty more probably there's not
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.132,INTJ,anymore but a JavaScript framework
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.133,INTJ,essentially is a framework that helps
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.134,INTJ,people to or helps developers to build
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.135,INTJ,apps it does a lot of what you would
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.136,INTJ,call the heavy lifting of an application
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.137,INTJ,now each frameworks different but
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.138,INTJ,essentially many of them cover some of
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.139,INTJ,these sort of sort of things that you
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.140,INTJ,may want to do so things like routing in
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.141,INTJ,other words going from page to page of
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.142,INTJ,the application displaying different
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.143,INTJ,components of the app that's something
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.144,INTJ,that can be very tedious but that some
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.145,INTJ,of the frameworks will do for you
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.146,INTJ,another one is connecting to data
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.147,INTJ,services so connecting to your back-end
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.148,INTJ,servers serializing or deserializing the
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.149,INTJ,information being able to keep track of
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.150,INTJ,authentication and security tokens a lot
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.151,INTJ,of these frameworks make that a whole
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.152,INTJ,lot easier and it means you won't have
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.153,INTJ,to sort of roll or create your own
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.154,INTJ,framework or little module functionality
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.155,INTJ,for every app that you create now look
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.156,INTJ,the topic of JavaScript frameworks could
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.157,INTJ,really take its own videos so suffice to
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.158,INTJ,say that it is if you're gonna become a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.159,INTJ,web developer it's gonna be something
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.160,INTJ,that you're gonna learn a lot about and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.161,INTJ,something that you should probably learn
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.162,INTJ,about if you want to learn JavaScript
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.163,INTJ,Java scripts also available as a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.164,INTJ,server-side language in nodejs which
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.165,INTJ,allows you to create a basically
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.166,INTJ,server-side functionality using
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.167,INTJ,javascript so you could have a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.168,INTJ,potentially front-end with JavaScript
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.169,INTJ,and back in with JavaScript even more
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.170,INTJ,than that Java scripts available as a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.171,INTJ,database language there are two that
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.172,INTJ,come to mind right away it's MongoDB and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.173,INTJ,CouchDB that use JavaScript
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.174,INTJ,their programming language as well so
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.175,INTJ,really you could have a entire stack
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.176,INTJ,from front to back and be JavaScript you
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.177,INTJ,want to create a mobile app potentially
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.178,INTJ,well JavaScript actually allows you to
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.179,INTJ,do that as well I've actually used in
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.180,INTJ,the past I've used ionic which is a sort
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.181,INTJ,of framework that will allow you to
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.182,INTJ,create a mobile app using angular
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.183,INTJ,essentially and we'll take that and sort
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.184,INTJ,of how would you say it will create a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.185,INTJ,mobile app for both Android and iOS that
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.186,INTJ,is sort of like it's it's it looks and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.187,INTJ,feels like a mobile app but it's really
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.188,INTJ,just rendering sort of HTML and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.189,INTJ,JavaScript now that's not the same as
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.190,INTJ,creating an iOS app in the native
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.191,INTJ,language but it can be sort of a
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.192,INTJ,substitute if you don't have a mobile
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.193,INTJ,developer and you can you can obviously
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.194,INTJ,access so it's definitely not the same
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.195,INTJ,as creating a mobile app but you can
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.196,INTJ,definitely get decently close to it and
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.197,INTJ,lastly you can actually create desktop
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.198,INTJ,apps using JavaScript HTML and CSS with
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.199,INTJ,a framework called electrons so you
INTJ_Javascript Explained! Javascript PRIMER video for beginners.200,INTJ,could create a sort of full-fledged
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)0,ESFJc,"All right, so some of you might know that I just quit my data science job at bank"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)1,ESFJc,the reason why I'm not seeing explicitly which company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)2,ESFJc,"It's in case I need to go begging back for my job, you know, and I don't want them to say that"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)3,ESFJc,"Oh my god, what did you say this about a company?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)4,ESFJc,We're not gonna take you back now before I go into why I quit my job
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)5,ESFJc,I kind of have to re-explain what my role was as a data scientist
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)6,ESFJc,and the reason why I have to react splain it is because
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)7,ESFJc,It's not as standardized as like software engineering which is I mean III know I explained in a lot of videos
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)8,ESFJc,but I'm just gonna do it again just so that you can have
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)9,ESFJc,the right context to understand why I quit so basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)10,ESFJc,this was my job title at this company and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)11,ESFJc,"Yeah, so you can read it"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)12,ESFJc,so in essence in my words
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)13,ESFJc,A data scientist is usually put into a product team and usually in the product team. There's a product manager
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)14,ESFJc,"there are software engineers and there's a data scientist now, obviously there are other roles, you know, for example like UX researchers and"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)15,ESFJc,Like product specialists
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)16,ESFJc,"Marketing people legal people and stuff like that, but I'm just gonna you know, simplify it and say ok"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)17,ESFJc,So there's software engineers and data scientists and product managers
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)18,ESFJc,"So I'm not gonna explain it in a way where it's like, oh data scientists. They make models"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)19,ESFJc,"They use like R and likes are for engineers, they build infrastructure and they use programming languages blah blah blah"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)20,ESFJc,I'm not gonna explain like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)21,ESFJc,I'm gonna explain it in a more fundamental way of what their roles actually are. So
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)22,ESFJc,Engineers they actually have the technical abilities to build the thing. We actually want to build product managers
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)23,ESFJc,They're basically the leaders are like the owners of the product. They decide what the product is going to do
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)24,ESFJc,And also what the product should be doing. Basically they have the vision and they're in charge of actually executing getting the shit done and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)25,ESFJc,"You know, they'll do whatever they need to do to actually ship a product in some ways"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)26,ESFJc,You could think of them as like mini CEOs of a product or a feature and then data scientists
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)27,ESFJc,we have the most time to think because we
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)28,ESFJc,Don't need to like build anything like for engineers and stuff like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)29,ESFJc,And we also don't need to focus on execute and talking to cross-functional partners all the time
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)30,ESFJc,So in some ways because we're able to think more than those two counterparts
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)31,ESFJc,We're basically like advisors are like consultants of like the product. We don't actually make the final decisions and calls
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)32,ESFJc,I mean obviously your opinions matter
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)33,ESFJc,but in in essence the the people who had the final say are kind of the product managers and also the engineers because
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)34,ESFJc,The engineers are going to build it so they could build whatever they want and then product managers
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)35,ESFJc,They're the ones
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)36,ESFJc,They're the ones that decide on the future of the product now because we have so much time to think our job is
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)37,ESFJc,To try to understand the product inside and out. We're suppose
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)38,ESFJc,Not I'm not saying all data scientists do that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)39,ESFJc,but I think
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)40,ESFJc,That the fundamental role of a data scientist is to understand the product in and out better than anyone else
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)41,ESFJc,"The reason is because like I said, you have more time to think you have more time in your hand"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)42,ESFJc,So basically we use data to try to understand exactly
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)43,ESFJc,what the product needs and where the product should go in terms of the product direction and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)44,ESFJc,What we can do is we can tell our team exactly where we should prioritize and how we should do certain things
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)45,ESFJc,"Why because we have so much time to think about it, you know, we don't need to build stuff"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)46,ESFJc,We don't need to execute on anything. So that's a role
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)47,ESFJc,We're always making sure that the team is working on the most important things
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)48,ESFJc,"Currently, okay, I'll do one more analogy just because I like doing analogies. So imagine a youtube channel, right?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)49,ESFJc,Engineers would be like video producers which is the people who actually know how to make videos because in the end if you don't have
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)50,ESFJc,A video you're not gonna have a video channel
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)51,ESFJc,"so I think of Engineers like video producers and then product managers, I think of product managers as"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)52,ESFJc,The people who?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)53,ESFJc,What it doesn't need to be multiple people
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)54,ESFJc,it could just be one person but basically the person who sends emails tries to look for sponsorships and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)55,ESFJc,"They think about okay, where should this channel go? Basically they do everything that's not related to videos"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)56,ESFJc,"You know, we got Brandon we got sending emails making websites communicating with other youtubers. Basically just all the crap that"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)57,ESFJc,Video producers might not want to do so
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)58,ESFJc,I think those people are like the product and then we got a data science
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)59,ESFJc,The data scientists would be kind of like an an analyst of your YouTube channel
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)60,ESFJc,What analysis would do is they would all they always look at analytics to make sure that?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)61,ESFJc,You know you get some insights to know what kind of videos to make next like for example
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)62,ESFJc,You look at the views and they say that okay
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)63,ESFJc,You know these things are kind of hot right now or this is kind of trending
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)64,ESFJc,And you look at comments - basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)65,ESFJc,"You're like you're trying to understand your users the best way you can using data or anything. Actually, it doesn't even matter"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)66,ESFJc,It doesn't even need to be data. So basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)67,ESFJc,those are the fundamental rows basically a data scientist should figure out you know how to get more subscribers how to get more views and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)68,ESFJc,Why are certain things working or are certain things not working?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)69,ESFJc,"So then give them insights give the product manager or like the video producer insights into like okay, which you make next"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)70,ESFJc,How should we you know like these strategies? Okay. I know that was kind of long just to explain
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)71,ESFJc,"fundamentally, what a data scientist is"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)72,ESFJc,Fuck I need water
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)73,ESFJc,"Okay, I'm too lazy to get water okay, but um basically the reason why I quit my data science job in essence"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)74,ESFJc,It's because I'm still exploring
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)75,ESFJc,so I guess what I'm trying to say is a lot of people are content with their first job out of college and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)76,ESFJc,For my case. I think that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)77,ESFJc,For the first years out of your college
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)78,ESFJc,It is totally okay to keep searching and try to understand yourself and try to understand what exactly
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)79,ESFJc,"Is a right fit for your in terms of a job like I prioritize well, I might be wrong"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)80,ESFJc,"I don't know but I prioritize long term like for example, if"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)81,ESFJc,"you know, I just stuck of data scientists and"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)82,ESFJc,In the future. I realize I hate the job
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)83,ESFJc,then the cost of switching jobs is a lot higher later on if I was already five years or six years in so I do
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)84,ESFJc,think that sacrificing the first few years
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)85,ESFJc,Trying to discover what you actually want
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)86,ESFJc,"It's definitely beneficial for your career. Hopefully, I don't know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)87,ESFJc,"We'll see so I'm not saying oh by the way, I'm switching to software engineering"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)88,ESFJc,I have a feeling that some people don't know but I'm not saying that software engineering is my
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)89,ESFJc,True calling or that this is the final job that I want. I don't know. I'm not sure I might be wrong
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)90,ESFJc,"You know, I might not even last for like another year or two"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)91,ESFJc,But in the current state that I am right now
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)92,ESFJc,"I feel that I don't want to do you know the analytics part like, you know?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)93,ESFJc,The YouTube guy where he just looks at analytics. I kind of want to make videos
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)94,ESFJc,I want to be a video producer
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)95,ESFJc,"So in this analogy, it means that I want to build things and I think that's currently what I want"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)96,ESFJc,at least what I think I want so that's why I'm gonna try out a software engineering now and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)97,ESFJc,"Yeah, cuz I thought that I was always a builder, you know, I do like some aspects of data scientists"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)98,ESFJc,"But you know, I want to try to build stuff this time like I think at the core"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)99,ESFJc,"My personality does fit more of a builder, you know, I do like building stuff. But yeah, so yeah"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)100,ESFJc,So those are the arguments of me wanting to become a software engineer
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)101,ESFJc,So I'm gonna talk about some things about why I don't want to be a data scientist anymore
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)102,ESFJc,So at least at my company or my old company the way you get
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)103,ESFJc,Evaluated no matter what role you have is how much impact you have?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)104,ESFJc,And basically what impact means is if you did you have like a positive contribution to the company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)105,ESFJc,"So even if you worked your ass off or you did, you know, you do a lot of smart intelligent things"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)106,ESFJc,But it doesn't have any positive impact to a company or like it doesn't really change anything
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)107,ESFJc,Then you still might get fired after a while. So as a data scientist using the scope that I talked about like the fundamental ROS
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)108,ESFJc,basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)109,ESFJc,how a data scientist can have impact in a company like that is by
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)110,ESFJc,Make like being like influencing the product. This is
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)111,ESFJc,influencing the product direction
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)112,ESFJc,so for a data scientist using that scope of like fundamental ROS a
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)113,ESFJc,Data scientists how they can have impact is by you know
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)114,ESFJc,Making analysis or something such that it leads into
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)115,ESFJc,actionable
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)116,ESFJc,Insight meaning that people will use that insight and then they'll take action to towards it and then it will benefit the company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)117,ESFJc,"So that's impact. All right, so I have a few examples. I'm just gonna read it out loud because I I can't remember them"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)118,ESFJc,So basically in a simple way if your analysis convey the engineers to build something and our metrics went up
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)119,ESFJc,That's impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)120,ESFJc,"Also, if your analysis convinced the PM and the team to put a new feature a or a project on the roadmap"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)121,ESFJc,That's impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)122,ESFJc,If you create an amazing
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)123,ESFJc,Prediction algorithm to predict whether a user watched a video with alone in their apartment or with friends
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)124,ESFJc,But the team didn't decide to implement it because they don't think it's useful that is not impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)125,ESFJc,if you found that Korea is a growing market for live videos and you have tons of evidence that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)126,ESFJc,Adding a donation button can make your company dominant in the live video market in in Korea
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)127,ESFJc,But even with their sound evidence you cannot convince your product team to focus on Korea. That is not impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)128,ESFJc,So as you can see
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)129,ESFJc,it's not always a hundred percent fair because for some team it might be easier than another and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)130,ESFJc,There's a lot of factor that plays into the success of a data scientist and some of them are out of your control
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)131,ESFJc,And that was one thing that I found a little bit harder to cope with
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)132,ESFJc,Now I've worked with teams where it was really really easy to find opportunities and then you show those
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)133,ESFJc,"Opportunities to them and then they're super excited and they'll do it, you know, and that's a lot of impact"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)134,ESFJc,but I've also worked for teams that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)135,ESFJc,Move a lot
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)136,ESFJc,"slower against a more friction and basically, you know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)137,ESFJc,you don't have as much credibility to them and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)138,ESFJc,And it's a lot more difficult to convince them to do what you want to do. So that's why it's a little bit harder
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)139,ESFJc,"So and basically if you have no influence, you don't have impact as a data scientist now"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)140,ESFJc,"Sometimes you might be lucky that your work is so good that your work speaks for itself, right?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)141,ESFJc,But the reality is that in life that's not always the case. Sometimes you just have to be influential
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)142,ESFJc,"Basically, you have to have the skills to influence your peers let your engineering manager the product manager"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)143,ESFJc,you have to get them in the same team as you or you have to basically or
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)144,ESFJc,"Basically, you have to kind of convince them that your ideas are good and that they should implement it. But that's the thing"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)145,ESFJc,It doesn't always happen and sometimes you gotta be pretty good at like the office politics or like
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)146,ESFJc,you know stuff that or more like soft skills ish and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)147,ESFJc,I believe those were the skills I lacked or at least that's why I thought before and which made me kind of like yeah
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)148,ESFJc,Like believe it or not. I'm actually
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)149,ESFJc,kind of like a work introvert so
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)150,ESFJc,I'm also like still very inexperienced in in in understanding like the work
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)151,ESFJc,Dynamics and also like some office politics and stuff like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)152,ESFJc,I'm still quite new. So I mean I did get better but at the time
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)153,ESFJc,that was what made me want to switch to software engineering because I felt like I wasn't ready to be a product leader on my
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)154,ESFJc,"Team, I didn't feel like I had the maturity to make and influence decisions on my team"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)155,ESFJc,I didn't have the confidence in myself nor my work and that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)156,ESFJc,"Stressed me out. Yeah, that stressed me out now. Don't get me wrong"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)157,ESFJc,there's a lot of
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)158,ESFJc,aspects of data science that I
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)159,ESFJc,Enjoy and that I like and that I still like and I do hope that when I work as a suite that I could use
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)160,ESFJc,some of the things that I've learned and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)161,ESFJc,and use it as my advantage but basically how I think about it like my philosophy is that your goal should be like
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)162,ESFJc,"Oh, I should be really I should be a really good data scientist, or I should be a really good software engineer"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)163,ESFJc,You should be the ultimate worker
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)164,ESFJc,"Okay, that sounds kind of weird"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)165,ESFJc,"But basically what I'm trying to say is you want to be the guy who can solve everything with anything, right?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)166,ESFJc,Like if there's a problem
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)167,ESFJc,You're the guide to solve it
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)168,ESFJc,No matter if it's a technical problem a business problem or like analytics problem and stuff like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)169,ESFJc,you want to be the guy that people can depend on and that's the person that I'm trying to be and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)170,ESFJc,For now the skills. I want to work on or you know building skills like a software engineer
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)171,ESFJc,"So yeah, I mean, I haven't done that in ages. I kind of miss it. Okay"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)172,ESFJc,"So now what you know, what am I doing now? Well, I am unemployed"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)173,ESFJc,"So basically what I do is every day, I just sit on my ass and I work on interview problems"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)174,ESFJc,I do a couple of questions on alcoholics per die. Oh just so that I can refresh my memory on these coding interviews. Yeah
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)175,ESFJc,It's a good website. I highly recommend it
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)176,ESFJc,"Yeah, you should check it out. If you're if you're interviewing also, what else have I been doing?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)177,ESFJc,"Yeah, so, you know because I have so much time in my hand"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)178,ESFJc,I've been going to blind a lot blind. Is this like Anonymous?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)179,ESFJc,Forum app that you can check you could check like gossip
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)180,ESFJc,so basically when I worked at like my company X
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)181,ESFJc,what I could have done is I could have gone to
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)182,ESFJc,Blind and see what other people were talking about that also worked at company X so a basic a lots of gossip
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)183,ESFJc,But I also use it for non gossip and there's a lot of stuff that you can read about in like normal topics
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)184,ESFJc,We're just a bunch of people from Silicon Valley
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)185,ESFJc,"They just talk about random stuff and most of the time to talk about, you know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)186,ESFJc,switching company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)187,ESFJc,interviewing at your TCC
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)188,ESFJc,Total compensation how much they make it's a good way for me to get a feel of what the market is like right now
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)189,ESFJc,So I use it a lot
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)190,ESFJc,"Almost obsessively a lot of times I check like okay, you know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)191,ESFJc,You know company X interview process to kind of get a feel of like how they interview you. So that's what I do
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)192,ESFJc,I mean you guys should totally check it out. It's pretty cool
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)193,ESFJc,You know lots of lots of anonymous talks there
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)194,ESFJc,"yeah, so basically, um, you know, I mean I get a lot of questions sometimes from people saying like oh,"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)195,ESFJc,"How should I do X or where what should I do to find X Y or whatever. Oh wait, my camera's almost on"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)196,ESFJc,"Yeah, so pretty much like I get a lot of questions where sometimes I don't even know the answer"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)197,ESFJc,"But how do I get the answers, you know, I go to Google I go to you know algo expert to learn some stuff"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)198,ESFJc,I use blind to understand how the interview process or like I use a lot of these websites
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)199,ESFJc,So I feel like you know instead of me answering all the questions for you guys
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)200,ESFJc,"I should just give you the tools to answer these questions, right? So there's this quote. You know what they say"

ISFJc_What I Eat in A Week + 3 Year Vegan Update195,ISFJc,turmeric because it's just good for you
ISFJc_What I Eat in A Week + 3 Year Vegan Update196,ISFJc,and I actually drink this every day I
ISFJc_What I Eat in A Week + 3 Year Vegan Update197,ISFJc,just kind of forgot to film it every day
ISFJc_What I Eat in A Week + 3 Year Vegan Update198,ISFJc,but I had this drink every day of the
ISFJc_What I Eat in A Week + 3 Year Vegan Update199,ISFJc,week and Saturday I started off with
ISFJc_What I Eat in A Week + 3 Year Vegan Update200,ISFJc,some simple oats with some dried
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey0,ISFPc,hey guys it's Laila and I'm back from
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey1,ISFPc,the new video so this video is going to
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey2,ISFPc,be all about my software engineering
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey3,ISFPc,journey and where it all started where
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey4,ISFPc,I'm at and move it what I want to do the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey5,ISFPc,future and all that good stuff and I
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey6,ISFPc,hope it short video talk to you like
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey7,ISFPc,that but hopefully I will win in say a
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey8,ISFPc,get currently sounds of software
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey9,ISFPc,engineering it all started when I
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey10,ISFPc,started my internship so at the moment
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey11,ISFPc,I'm doing a four-year course
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey12,ISFPc,so it's computer science with artificial
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey13,ISFPc,intelligence and here English so I'm
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey14,ISFPc,currently in my industry here at the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey15,ISFPc,moment and I've been at a source for
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey16,ISFPc,eight months so far as a software
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey17,ISFPc,engineer intern so make sure you this is
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey18,ISFPc,where it all started and before that I
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey19,ISFPc,did do a software engineering module in
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey20,ISFPc,my second year and I kind of got an
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey21,ISFPc,insight on what software engineering is
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey22,ISFPc,all about in terms of testing in terms
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey23,ISFPc,of working a team in terms of
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey24,ISFPc,requirements customer requirements
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey25,ISFPc,business requirements also I learned
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey26,ISFPc,about agile and scrum yeah
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey27,ISFPc,about all these concepts that you need
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey28,ISFPc,soak right into my software engineering
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey29,ISFPc,internship I kind of knew bits about it
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey30,ISFPc,but I feel like everything just made
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey31,ISFPc,sense because I knew all of these terms
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey32,ISFPc,and keywords and it just made sense
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey33,ISFPc,like actually working so it's like uni
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey34,ISFPc,was like a fairy prep and then my
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey35,ISFPc,internships like the practical exercise
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey36,ISFPc,because I'm actually in a theme of
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey37,ISFPc,working on software to me and doing all
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey38,ISFPc,these different things so yeah it was
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey39,ISFPc,really cool you know what my journey
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey40,ISFPc,starts now that's that's the crazy thing
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey41,ISFPc,about it right now
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey42,ISFPc,back-end developments on the back ends
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey43,ISFPc,of the engineer and a lot of the work
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey44,ISFPc,here on c-sharp coding and working in
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey45,ISFPc,visual Studios to create a lot of
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey46,ISFPc,different types of tests and a lot of
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey47,ISFPc,different type of api's and all that
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey48,ISFPc,good stuff if you don't know these
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey49,ISFPc,concepts
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey50,ISFPc,please look it up and learn more about
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey51,ISFPc,it because this is which should be the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey52,ISFPc,starting point but yeah that's currently
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey53,ISFPc,what I'm doing at the moment so in terms
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey54,ISFPc,of my journey because this is the very
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey55,ISFPc,beginning and I don't really have a lot
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey56,ISFPc,of the gems tell you guys apart from be
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey57,ISFPc,enough work and obviously I'll tell you
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey58,ISFPc,guys a little bit more about my role
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey59,ISFPc,I'll tell you guys that this is just
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey60,ISFPc,kind of let you guys know I'm literally
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey61,ISFPc,just starting and if you're considering
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey62,ISFPc,doing software engineering as a career
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey63,ISFPc,as of now this is the video you and
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey64,ISFPc,these other videos this is the Chatham
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey65,ISFPc,meeting so yeah so oh yes so right
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey66,ISFPc,journey starts now
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey67,ISFPc,once I'm done with my internship I can
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey68,ISFPc,grab all that information that I've
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey69,ISFPc,learned and use that elsewhere where
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey70,ISFPc,it's in my evening or other jobs or the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey71,ISFPc,same job and yeah that's bitch mean what
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey72,ISFPc,doing at the moment I don't really know
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey73,ISFPc,it's a talk about software journeys
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey74,ISFPc,because I have a big hit for long time
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey75,ISFPc,but yeah but my goal is to get better at
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey76,ISFPc,Cody so to be honest you guys I am
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey77,ISFPc,actually able get very much
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey78,ISFPc,maybe I'm opens a dream but I have a
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey79,ISFPc,beginner and
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey80,ISFPc,I need to learn how to you know code by
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey81,ISFPc,myself make my project that's what I'm
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey82,ISFPc,planning to do I'm planning to build my
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey83,ISFPc,own app and I want to build it as a
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey84,ISFPc,business so that's something that I
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey85,ISFPc,would like to introduce a future I just
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey86,ISFPc,currently just coding around that just
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey87,ISFPc,to practice and get more better at it so
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey88,ISFPc,yeah that's that's the point where I'm
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey89,ISFPc,like now there's so many men who just
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey90,ISFPc,are gonna learn like PI for a law like
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey91,ISFPc,there's so many different languages that
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey92,ISFPc,one learn especially on the data science
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey93,ISFPc,book so yeah this kind of is a
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey94,ISFPc,contradictory video because I've loved
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey95,ISFPc,learning about data science I find it so
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey96,ISFPc,so interesting if you guys want to know
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey97,ISFPc,a little bit more about that please
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey98,ISFPc,comment below or like this video but
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey99,ISFPc,yeah so I'm hoping to finish my degree
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey100,ISFPc,and then go back into work whether it's
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey101,ISFPc,back at a source or a different role and
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey102,ISFPc,I've always felt a bit skeptical about
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey103,ISFPc,trying to like if it if I don't go back
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey104,ISFPc,to a source like triangle to the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey105,ISFPc,platform another job because I feel like
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey106,ISFPc,I'm not that experienced to programming
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey107,ISFPc,but like I don't let that not done
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey108,ISFPc,because I didn't really have that much
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey109,ISFPc,experience when I started my internship
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey110,ISFPc,and I learned so much and I've developed
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey111,ISFPc,so much so yeah I'm not gonna let that
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey112,ISFPc,bring me down that much but I feel like
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey113,ISFPc,in my last year evening I'm probably
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey114,ISFPc,good practice a lot so I can get to a
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey115,ISFPc,point where I'm actually confident and
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey116,ISFPc,happy but yeah if you guys know or
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey117,ISFPc,suggest any food OD websites or books
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey118,ISFPc,please comment below and I will write
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey119,ISFPc,them as well and once I'm actually quite
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey120,ISFPc,amusing
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey121,ISFPc,but yeah I've mentioned in the beginning
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey122,ISFPc,of time guys I am a beginner if you're
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey123,ISFPc,looking up let's get looking art and
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey124,ISFPc,then tie these two friends together
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey125,ISFPc,I'm just learning a lot and I'm pairing
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey126,ISFPc,a lot with people with my team and I'm
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey127,ISFPc,actually contributed a lot so I thought
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey128,ISFPc,like I didn't value to the team that I
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey129,ISFPc,am it's all engineering stuff like that
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey130,ISFPc,but I don't know I just feel like you
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey131,ISFPc,know if you know your potential and if
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey132,ISFPc,you just code a little bit more and just
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey133,ISFPc,work a little bit harder we'll just be
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey134,ISFPc,like this that's what that's the point
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey135,ISFPc,that I have so my journey at the moment
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey136,ISFPc,right now I just need to practice coding
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey137,ISFPc,period if you are like me and you're
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey138,ISFPc,lazy and you just sleep when you get
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey139,ISFPc,home watch movies watch Netflix stop
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey140,ISFPc,well don't stop but please put some time
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey141,ISFPc,in for coding as well because honestly
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey142,ISFPc,every day counts at the bank get the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey143,ISFPc,less harder it is for you to understand
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey144,ISFPc,and let it just be a language where you
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey145,ISFPc,just understand it but you don't have to
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey146,ISFPc,write it I was gonna say speech you
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey147,ISFPc,don't have to write it so that's the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey148,ISFPc,point where I might take my advice start
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey149,ISFPc,paving yeah I think you guys liked this
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey150,ISFPc,video was informative hopefully in the
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey151,ISFPc,next two years I will be doing an update
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey152,ISFPc,software to be a journey app you know
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey153,ISFPc,I'll be through the room I'll be I'll be
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey154,ISFPc,at the top hey guys I enjoyed this video
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey155,ISFPc,I got the day and I'll see those and see
ISFPc_My Software Engineering Journey156,ISFPc,[Music]
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO0,ISFPc,what's up guys it's Elizabeth Murray
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO1,ISFPc,here back at it again with another video
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO2,ISFPc,and today I just kind of wanted to talk
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO3,ISFPc,about living in the Bay Area all of god
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO4,ISFPc,what it's like and kind of my journey
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO5,ISFPc,since I've been here if you guys have
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO6,ISFPc,not already don't forget to like this
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO7,ISFPc,video and subscribe to my channel and
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO8,ISFPc,I'll just be putting out more videos
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO9,ISFPc,about what it's like living in the Bay
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO10,ISFPc,Area as well as doing vlogs about
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO11,ISFPc,certain things to do if you already live
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO12,ISFPc,here or if you're visiting things like
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO13,ISFPc,that um as far as my journey here in the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO14,ISFPc,Bay Area or San Francisco I moved to San
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO15,ISFPc,Francisco about nine months ago first
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO16,ISFPc,things first by living situation right
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO17,ISFPc,now I live in a two-bedroom two-bath you
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO18,ISFPc,have one roommate and we live in a 710
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO19,ISFPc,square foot apartment two got to give
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO20,ISFPc,you guys a perspective on you know how
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO21,ISFPc,big our apartment is and this is pretty
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO22,ISFPc,standard actually so if you're from
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO23,ISFPc,Texas where you know that's where I'm
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO24,ISFPc,originally from 7-10 square foot costs
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO25,ISFPc,you know like a regular one-bedroom
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO26,ISFPc,apartment for one person actually even
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO27,ISFPc,bigger than that there's not a lot of
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO28,ISFPc,space and so they kind of like try to
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO29,ISFPc,maximize it with not giving you know not
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO30,ISFPc,having a really big apartment space or
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO31,ISFPc,house whatever whatever it is it's it's
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO32,ISFPc,not too small I mean it kind of reminds
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO33,ISFPc,me of my college apartment so it's
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO34,ISFPc,definitely doable so a little bit of
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO35,ISFPc,background about myself so I moved out
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO36,ISFPc,here from Texas and uh I left my car in
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO37,ISFPc,Texas because my apartment charges about
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO38,ISFPc,three hundred and fifty dollars a month
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO39,ISFPc,for parking and I was definitely not
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO40,ISFPc,about to do that
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO41,ISFPc,so I left that thing in Texas and so
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO42,ISFPc,basically my main means of
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO43,ISFPc,transportation is Lester uber and also
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO44,ISFPc,carpool so carpool has really saved my
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO45,ISFPc,whole entire life but cuz my commute
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO46,ISFPc,from work from my house to work is about
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO47,ISFPc,about an hour and hour and a half
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO48,ISFPc,depending on traffic and taking the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO49,ISFPc,train here it's actually really
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO50,ISFPc,expensive it's that it's the opposite of
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO51,ISFPc,you know other cities so other cities if
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO52,ISFPc,you take public transportation it's way
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO53,ISFPc,cheaper than you know taking a car right
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO54,ISFPc,but here it's the opposite like if you
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO55,ISFPc,have a car it's actually a lot cheaper
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO56,ISFPc,to get around and taking the train and I
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO57,ISFPc,don't get it I don't know why everything
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO58,ISFPc,is just more expensive here whatever so
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO59,ISFPc,I've actually been using on to apps Waze
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO60,ISFPc,carpool and scoop and they essentially
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO61,ISFPc,match you with other people who have
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO62,ISFPc,similar commutes and they pick you up
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO63,ISFPc,close to your house or at your house and
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO64,ISFPc,then they also drop you at work or close
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO65,ISFPc,to work so it's been a lifesaver for me
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO66,ISFPc,because when I first moved I was taking
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO67,ISFPc,the train every day and maybe spending
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO68,ISFPc,about 40 dollars a day just solely on
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO69,ISFPc,taking the train just because I had to
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO70,ISFPc,take a looper to the Train take the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO71,ISFPc,train and then take an uber from the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO72,ISFPc,train to my job and back so all of that
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO73,ISFPc,added up and it was just it was a
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO74,ISFPc,nightmare so I thought that is a tip for
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO75,ISFPc,you guys if you are already live in the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO76,ISFPc,Bay Area and are struggling with your
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO77,ISFPc,commute or are planning to move to the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO78,ISFPc,Bay Area and don't know what you're
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO79,ISFPc,gonna be doing as far as transportation
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO80,ISFPc,so that's also an option for you they
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO81,ISFPc,also have another option in uber called
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO82,ISFPc,uber Express and that essentially makes
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO83,ISFPc,you walk like a block or two from the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO84,ISFPc,location that you enter in and it is
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO85,ISFPc,essentially like essentially it
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO86,ISFPc,optimizes the time for the driver as
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO87,ISFPc,well as the rider that you're riding
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO88,ISFPc,with and it saves time basically so um
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO89,ISFPc,that's also an option that they have
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO90,ISFPc,here that that they don't have in other
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO91,ISFPc,cities so I originally knew San
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO92,ISFPc,Francisco was a lot colder than on the
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO93,ISFPc,rest of California however I really
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO94,ISFPc,never thought about how much colder was
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO95,ISFPc,gonna be it literally is you know low of
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO96,ISFPc,50 high of 60 pretty much the whole year
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO97,ISFPc,and
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO98,ISFPc,a lot warmer so right now it's October
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO99,ISFPc,end of October and it's now starting to
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO100,ISFPc,warm up so it's now finally starting to
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO101,ISFPc,get into the high 60 high 60s and I'm
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO102,ISFPc,literally living my best life because
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO103,ISFPc,I'm from Texas you know I'm used to
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO104,ISFPc,thinking soon so coming out here you
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO105,ISFPc,know I was like yeah I'm gonna
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO106,ISFPc,California
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO107,ISFPc,pack my shorts yeah I know I I don't
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO108,ISFPc,think I ever wore my shorts all here to
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO109,ISFPc,be honest like I'm literally always in
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO110,ISFPc,jackets
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO111,ISFPc,it's like pants you know whatever so but
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO112,ISFPc,it's finally warming up now end of
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO113,ISFPc,October and I'm really happy about that
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO114,ISFPc,they call it the Indian summer so um
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO115,ISFPc,yeah it's definitely we got our summer
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO116,ISFPc,but it's a lot later than the rest of
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO117,ISFPc,the country I will be doing another
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO118,ISFPc,video on like my apartment tour just so
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO119,ISFPc,you guys can kind of see on you know how
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO120,ISFPc,an average-sized apartment is here and
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO121,ISFPc,San Francisco though those are the main
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO122,ISFPc,things that I wanted to talk about today
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO123,ISFPc,don't forget to thumbs up to this video
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO124,ISFPc,subscribe to my channel and I will see
ISFPc_LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO125,ISFPc,you guys the next one bye

ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty22,ISTJc,think about advice that piece of advice
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty23,ISTJc,that good things come to those who wait
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty24,ISTJc,because today we're doing about creating
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty25,ISTJc,opportunities so actually I want to
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty26,ISTJc,change that my opinion on that quote is
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty27,ISTJc,that we need to change that from good
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty28,ISTJc,things come to those who wait to good
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty29,ISTJc,things come to those who create the
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty30,ISTJc,people that actually create their own
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty31,ISTJc,opportunities the people that take
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty32,ISTJc,responsibility and ownership to make a
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty33,ISTJc,difference in their life and the lives
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty34,ISTJc,of other people and as we've been
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty35,ISTJc,building this global conscious community
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty36,ISTJc,I know so many of you have stimulating
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty37,ISTJc,ideas about how you're going to bring
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty38,ISTJc,about change we often think that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty39,ISTJc,creative opportunity means it has to be
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty40,ISTJc,rushed or hurried or it means you have
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty41,ISTJc,to have lots of stuff going on and
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty42,ISTJc,sometimes that can get quite draining it
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty43,ISTJc,can get quite overwhelming it can start
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty44,ISTJc,to feel as if we don't know how we're
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty45,ISTJc,going to move forward but what I notice
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty46,ISTJc,now is that we need to balance that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty47,ISTJc,theory with the value of creating
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty48,ISTJc,opportunities there's a great quote by a
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty49,ISTJc,Roman philosopher named Seneca where he
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty50,ISTJc,said that luck is what happens when
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty51,ISTJc,preparation meets opportunity
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty52,ISTJc,right that's what happens when
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty53,ISTJc,preparation meets opportunity something
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty54,ISTJc,that we don't really have a lot of
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty55,ISTJc,talked about today and I was thinking
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty56,ISTJc,about I used to have an economics
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty57,ISTJc,teacher and this economics teacher I
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty58,ISTJc,remember the first day you
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty59,ISTJc,walked into school he walked into school
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty60,ISTJc,I still I believe we had whiteboards by
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty61,ISTJc,that time I'm not out he had whiteboard
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty62,ISTJc,and on the whiteboard he wrote down he
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty63,ISTJc,goes failing to prepare is preparing to
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty64,ISTJc,fail and I remember all of us is
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty65,ISTJc,bursting out laughing and we just
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty66,ISTJc,thought oh my god is he a philosopher or
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty67,ISTJc,an economics teacher right here oh but
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty68,ISTJc,failing to prepare is preparing to fail
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty69,ISTJc,he wrote that down on the board and I'm
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty70,ISTJc,thinking to myself I'm going oh my god
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty71,ISTJc,another one of these philosophers
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty72,ISTJc,because I wasn't even into philosophy
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty73,ISTJc,myself and when he broke that down now
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty74,ISTJc,I'm gonna look back and I think wow that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty75,ISTJc,was such a powerful statement that was
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty76,ISTJc,so true so Seneca Roman philosopher says
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty77,ISTJc,the same thing he says luck is what
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty78,ISTJc,happens when preparation meets
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty79,ISTJc,opportunity
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty80,ISTJc,so one of the things I wanted to talked
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty81,ISTJc,about how do we create opportunity in
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty82,ISTJc,our life when we're trying to develop
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty83,ISTJc,patience within ourselves you'll find
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty84,ISTJc,that when you're working to your purpose
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty85,ISTJc,when you're working in a connected way
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty86,ISTJc,when you're working in the direction
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty87,ISTJc,where you feel focus you naturally
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty88,ISTJc,develop patience we often feel we don't
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty89,ISTJc,have patience when things aren't working
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty90,ISTJc,out and things usually don't work out
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty91,ISTJc,when we're not working in a way that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty92,ISTJc,works for us one of the things that I
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty93,ISTJc,wanted to speak to you about talking
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty94,ISTJc,about that is the ability to really
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty95,ISTJc,understand times at which when we need
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty96,ISTJc,to make things almost difficult again
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty97,ISTJc,now I don't need to invite difficulties
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty98,ISTJc,into your life that's not what I'm
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty99,ISTJc,recommending but hear me out for a
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty100,ISTJc,second what I'm trying to say is that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty101,ISTJc,often you have to go back to feeling
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty102,ISTJc,feeling like you have nothing so that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty103,ISTJc,you can create something again a great
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty104,ISTJc,example of this was actually ela musk
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty105,ISTJc,and I don't know how many of you've read
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty106,ISTJc,his autobiography it's absolutely
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty107,ISTJc,phenomenal story biography and he talked
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty108,ISTJc,about that when he sold PayPal his
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty109,ISTJc,earnings were 180 million now he split
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty110,ISTJc,that straight away I think in a matter
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty111,ISTJc,of about three months he put a hundred
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty112,ISTJc,million into SpaceX he put 70 million
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty113,ISTJc,into Tesla and he put 10 million into
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty114,ISTJc,Solar City if you add that all up if
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty115,ISTJc,you're cricket maps and you've probably
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty116,ISTJc,done it already that's 180 million
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty117,ISTJc,already gone right he said that he was
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty118,ISTJc,struggling to pay rent he had to borrow
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty119,ISTJc,money to pay rent the guy's a
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty120,ISTJc,millionaire why did he do that he says
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty121,ISTJc,that he had to feel that desperation
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty122,ISTJc,again that ability to want to make a
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty123,ISTJc,change
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty124,ISTJc,yet we live that you can create
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty125,ISTJc,opportunity in your life if you're
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty126,ISTJc,someone who thinks maybe it's your
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty127,ISTJc,business maybe it's in your
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty128,ISTJc,relationships maybe it's at work
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty129,ISTJc,wherever it is whether you're an
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty130,ISTJc,entrepreneur you try to grow your career
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty131,ISTJc,wherever you are we all need to create
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty132,ISTJc,opportunities how can we do that but how
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty133,ISTJc,do we all take that leap of faith
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty134,ISTJc,so you're somewhere you're okay with
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty135,ISTJc,where you're at you're probably saying
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty136,ISTJc,okay you're with where you're right
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty137,ISTJc,you're comfortable with it but you know
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty138,ISTJc,that there's more out there for you how
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty139,ISTJc,do you take that leap of faith one of
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty140,ISTJc,the ways that I believe we take that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty141,ISTJc,leap of faith is actually launch
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty142,ISTJc,something new then talk about it rather
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty143,ISTJc,than the other way around often what we
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty144,ISTJc,do is we spend a lot of our time talking
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty145,ISTJc,about doing something and we never get
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty146,ISTJc,around to actually making it happen but
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty147,ISTJc,actually what I recommend is just start
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty148,ISTJc,doing something small I love talking
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty149,ISTJc,about Facebook when Facebook first
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty150,ISTJc,launched it was only meant to be for
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty151,ISTJc,Harvard right Mark Zuckerberg Amedda it
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty152,ISTJc,works for Harvard it then branched out
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty153,ISTJc,to the Ivy League universities in the
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty154,ISTJc,States it then branched out over to
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty155,ISTJc,Cambridge and Oxford and the top
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty156,ISTJc,universities and institutions in England
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty157,ISTJc,and then I believe across the world but
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty158,ISTJc,notice that it's a testing period and
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty159,ISTJc,you see loads of tech firms do this
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty160,ISTJc,brilliantly today they're experts at
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty161,ISTJc,starting small and scaling up so the my
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty162,ISTJc,main recommendation is start small do
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty163,ISTJc,not try and start big and really think
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty164,ISTJc,about how you can launch something and
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty165,ISTJc,then talk about it don't start talking
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty166,ISTJc,about something first
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty167,ISTJc,usually when you throw out an idea if
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty168,ISTJc,you get criticism for it straight away
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty169,ISTJc,you're less likely to see it through how
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty170,ISTJc,many of you have ever seen a article and
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty171,ISTJc,a new app a new book a new idea and
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty172,ISTJc,you've got oh my god I had the idea like
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty173,ISTJc,two years ago how many of you ever felt
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty174,ISTJc,that way right I've been in that camp
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty175,ISTJc,right my hands right up put your virtual
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty176,ISTJc,hands up if that's one of you it happens
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty177,ISTJc,to all of us all the time you see a new
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty178,ISTJc,launch of a restaurant you see a new
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty179,ISTJc,launch of a product and you say but I
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty180,ISTJc,had that idea I came up with that the
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty181,ISTJc,funny thing is if you came up with that
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty182,ISTJc,idea
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty183,ISTJc,two years ago it means someone started
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty184,ISTJc,working on it for years ago notice it's
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty185,ISTJc,the people who start acting quicker
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty186,ISTJc,they're the ones you grow quicker so
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty187,ISTJc,kids don't do what you say they do is
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty188,ISTJc,you do the way we behave so if children
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty189,ISTJc,see has been impatient all the time
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty190,ISTJc,they're naturally going to be impatient
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty191,ISTJc,I'm not saying any of you are impatient
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty192,ISTJc,but it it's definitely possible that it
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty193,ISTJc,works that way I was talking with the
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty194,ISTJc,monk about three years ago and I was
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty195,ISTJc,having this conversation in this
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty196,ISTJc,dialogue about being extremely ambitious
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty197,ISTJc,wanting to make lots of things happen
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty198,ISTJc,and I said how do you know where to put
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty199,ISTJc,your energy and he gave me a phenomenal
ISTJc_Creating Opportunities | Think Out Loud With Jay Shetty200,ISTJc,response and his response was that you
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)0,ISTJc,all right so I'm gonna talk a little bit
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)1,ISTJc,about nostalgia as an ist ga I think I I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)2,ISTJc,think I talked about something similar
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)3,ISTJc,before in another video I can't remember
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)4,ISTJc,but I have a weird relationship with
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)5,ISTJc,nostalgia
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)6,ISTJc,that's sort of a stereotype that is TJ's
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)7,ISTJc,are you know we're naturally or SI Dom's
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)8,ISTJc,in general are naturally I guess
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)9,ISTJc,inclined to be nostalgic same with
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)10,ISTJc,probably INF peas as well but uh I have
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)11,ISTJc,a strange relationship with nostalgia
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)12,ISTJc,one thing I noticed with me as I am sort
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)13,ISTJc,of aware of my quasi inclination towards
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)14,ISTJc,nostalgia and I avoid it like the plague
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)15,ISTJc,so one example would be I might have a
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)16,ISTJc,lot of old photos on my on my phone and
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)17,ISTJc,let's say I run out of space I mean if
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)18,ISTJc,you're really nostalgic you'd probably
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)19,ISTJc,want to upload those photos to something
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)20,ISTJc,and save them but for me I intentionally
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)21,ISTJc,delete old photos I get rid of them and
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)22,ISTJc,I long times I don't hold on to old
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)23,ISTJc,stuff I mean sometimes I do but I mean
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)24,ISTJc,if I can I like to force myself to get
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)25,ISTJc,rid of old stuff because I don't want to
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)26,ISTJc,feel the I guess emotional pain of
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)27,ISTJc,having to come to terms with something
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)28,ISTJc,that's past me or something that's gone
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)29,ISTJc,by and I won't get back so for that
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)30,ISTJc,reason you know even though I might have
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)31,ISTJc,pleasant memories about things there's
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)32,ISTJc,some things that I don't always like to
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)33,ISTJc,think about because if I really enjoyed
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)34,ISTJc,a certain period in my life I don't want
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)35,ISTJc,to be constantly reminded that that's
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)36,ISTJc,over and I'm not getting that back a lot
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)37,ISTJc,of people like to like you know play an
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)38,ISTJc,old song that reminds them of when they
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)39,ISTJc,were like a teenager or something and
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)40,ISTJc,reminisce about those times but to me
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)41,ISTJc,that sort of thing just makes me sad
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)42,ISTJc,more than anything if I'm listening to
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)43,ISTJc,an old song it's probably because not
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)44,ISTJc,for the nostalgia it's probably cuz I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)45,ISTJc,actually like that song outside of
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)46,ISTJc,whatever memories are associated with it
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)47,ISTJc,so I tend to kind of avoid those cuz I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)48,ISTJc,honestly I'm afraid of more negative
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)49,ISTJc,emotions I like to keep things positive
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)50,ISTJc,I don't I don't particularly feel
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)51,ISTJc,comfortable
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)52,ISTJc,with negative emotions I don't really
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)53,ISTJc,know how to handle them now the reason I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)54,ISTJc,bring this up is because I had somebody
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)55,ISTJc,who's familiar or I guess pretty
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)56,ISTJc,knowledgeable on over in the Dave super
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)57,ISTJc,powers objective personality sect of the
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)58,ISTJc,typology community now I know a lot of
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)59,ISTJc,you probably aren't Dave super powers
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)60,ISTJc,fans or some of you are some of you
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)61,ISTJc,probably don't like them some of you
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)62,ISTJc,probably think his systems wack I'm just
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)63,ISTJc,offering another perspective so I had
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)64,ISTJc,someone telling me that uh or at least
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)65,ISTJc,they personally do type me still as an
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)66,ISTJc,ISTJ both in their system and of course
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)67,ISTJc,in whatever system I use but I mean I'm
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)68,ISTJc,I would say I use more of a socionics
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)69,ISTJc,sort of angle on things but apparently
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)70,ISTJc,an individual from the objective
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)71,ISTJc,personality community they also taught
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)72,ISTJc,me as nice to Jay but what they said is
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)73,ISTJc,they have what's known as like an animal
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)74,ISTJc,stack and so they had me they had me
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)75,ISTJc,blast play consume sleep now what it
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)76,ISTJc,means having sleep last in that stack is
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)77,ISTJc,that because of my function stack and
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)78,ISTJc,the way everything is I would actually I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)79,ISTJc,would actually have a better
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)80,ISTJc,relationship with my extraverted
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)81,ISTJc,intuition that my introverted feeling
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)82,ISTJc,because when you have play and consume
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)83,ISTJc,yeah when you have play and consume
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)84,ISTJc,before sleep it means you're going to be
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)85,ISTJc,using your extroverted functions or at
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)86,ISTJc,least that that third of that fourth
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)87,ISTJc,expert intuition you're gonna be using
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)88,ISTJc,that more than you would your FI because
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)89,ISTJc,in order to touch that
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)90,ISTJc,that last introverted function you'd
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)91,ISTJc,need to have sleep higher up so
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)92,ISTJc,basically even though at least in their
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)93,ISTJc,system even though Annie's my force loss
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)94,ISTJc,function my my most difficult
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)95,ISTJc,relationship would have to be with
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)96,ISTJc,introverted feeling at least according
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)97,ISTJc,to objective personality I know a lot of
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)98,ISTJc,you were just gonna disagree with them
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)99,ISTJc,and say that that's not their systems
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)100,ISTJc,wack but just another perspective so
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)101,ISTJc,according to them my or this one
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)102,ISTJc,individual I shouldn't say them cuz I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)103,ISTJc,don't know if everyone enough Opie would
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)104,ISTJc,type me the same but according to this
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)105,ISTJc,person MA
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)106,ISTJc,I yeah sleep is lost so my weirdest
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)107,ISTJc,relationship is gonna be with my
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)108,ISTJc,introverted feeling it's gonna be the
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)109,ISTJc,last thing I do the last thing I'm do is
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)110,ISTJc,gonna be getting in touch with my
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)111,ISTJc,emotions it's what I don't do enough of
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)112,ISTJc,basically it's what I need to learn to
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)113,ISTJc,do more of spending time analyzing my
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)114,ISTJc,feelings so basically it's yeah so I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)115,ISTJc,would explain why I have a weird
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)116,ISTJc,relationship with nostalgia and I'm not
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)117,ISTJc,comfortable with negative emotions I'm
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)118,ISTJc,not basically in a nutshell I'm not very
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)119,ISTJc,comfortable with my own feelings and I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)120,ISTJc,don't spend enough time sort of
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)121,ISTJc,reflecting on them and really getting
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)122,ISTJc,down to how I feel about things it sort
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)123,ISTJc,of swept under the rug I need to
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)124,ISTJc,basically learn to spend more time
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)125,ISTJc,engaging with how I really feel
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)126,ISTJc,independent of any other forces just how
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)127,ISTJc,do I feel what do I actually want and
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)128,ISTJc,according to them my si my introverted
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)129,ISTJc,sensing and my exterior thing would be
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)130,ISTJc,masculine functions for me I'd be double
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)131,ISTJc,masculine ISTJ
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)132,ISTJc,but that would mean my bottom two
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)133,ISTJc,functions fi and Annie would be feminine
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)134,ISTJc,soul mate feminine fi combined with also
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)135,ISTJc,being one of my demon functions and
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)136,ISTJc,combined with being sleep last would
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)137,ISTJc,mean I'm kind of wishy-washy and how I
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)138,ISTJc,feel and I also don't engage with it
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)139,ISTJc,very much so fi is supposed to be like a
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)140,ISTJc,trouble area for me at least an
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)141,ISTJc,objective personality compared to most
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)142,ISTJc,I guess usual is DJs but yeah that would
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)143,ISTJc,explain why I have you know a peculiar
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)144,ISTJc,relationship with nostalgia despite
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)145,ISTJc,being an IAS DJ and a peculiar
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)146,ISTJc,relationship with my emotions in general
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)147,ISTJc,well it's all I got
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)148,ISTJc,more of an objective personality
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)149,ISTJc,perspective I know a lot of you probably
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)150,ISTJc,aren't down with their stuff or might
ISTJc_OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY ISTJ (MM Si Te BPCS)151,ISTJc,disagree but whatever just another thing

ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba0,ESTP,instead I needed to literally like bring
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba1,ESTP,my hat on the wall struggle struggle
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba2,ESTP,struggle debug if I knew that before I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba3,ESTP,would have encouraged myself to acquire
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba4,ESTP,that skill a little earlier on you know
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba5,ESTP,there is this big stereotype around oh
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba6,ESTP,if you're a software engineer you're
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba7,ESTP,just sitting somewhere in the corner
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba8,ESTP,impostor syndrome hit me personally
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba9,ESTP,really quickly so impostor syndrome is
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba10,ESTP,definitely 100% real hi everyone welcome
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba11,ESTP,back to my channel hope you're all
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba12,ESTP,having a wonderful day and in this video
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba13,ESTP,today I would love to tell you more
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba14,ESTP,about things that I wish I knew before I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba15,ESTP,became a software engineer so stay tuned
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba16,ESTP,[Music]
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba17,ESTP,something that I definitely wish on you
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba18,ESTP,before I became a software engineer is
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba19,ESTP,that switch in the mindset around
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba20,ESTP,failure and embracing struggle as a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba21,ESTP,chemical engineer because I studied
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba22,ESTP,Chemical Engineering in university of
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba23,ESTP,course problem solving was super
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba24,ESTP,important but a lot of the times it was
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba25,ESTP,also about the knowledge that you
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba26,ESTP,acquired around you know knowing certain
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba27,ESTP,laws know in certain processes and being
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba28,ESTP,able to really apply a formula to a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba29,ESTP,problem and get further with it most of
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba30,ESTP,the times you don't really have a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba31,ESTP,formula that you can apply to solve a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba32,ESTP,problem so you really need to be okay
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba33,ESTP,with failure be okay with having to
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba34,ESTP,struggle for a while and failing fast
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba35,ESTP,and then learning from it
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba36,ESTP,so that is something that I wish I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba37,ESTP,developed a bit earlier on before I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba38,ESTP,became a software engineer because in my
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba39,ESTP,first year as an engineer especially as
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba40,ESTP,an internal so when I when I started
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba41,ESTP,doing internships I was a lot of the
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba42,ESTP,times kind of looking for that perfect
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba43,ESTP,formula that would solve my problems but
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba44,ESTP,it just didn't exist and instead I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba45,ESTP,needed to literally like bang my hat on
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba46,ESTP,the wall
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba47,ESTP,struggle struggle struggle debug really
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba48,ESTP,tried to get down to the deep end of the
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba49,ESTP,problem to really understand it before
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba50,ESTP,you know moving on and finding a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba51,ESTP,solution and if I knew that before I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba52,ESTP,would have encouraged myself to acquire
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba53,ESTP,that skill a little earlier on so if
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba54,ESTP,you're just becoming a software engineer
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba55,ESTP,or you just started or you're thinking
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba56,ESTP,of embarking on this career path I would
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba57,ESTP,definitely embrace that mindset of
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba58,ESTP,failing fast and learning from your
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba59,ESTP,mistakes super early on another thing
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba60,ESTP,that I wish on you earlier or rather I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba61,ESTP,wish that I was aware of earlier and I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba62,ESTP,was okay with earlier is the fact that
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba63,ESTP,you might feel like an impostor you know
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba64,ESTP,especially when I started my career as a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba65,ESTP,software engineer a full time you know
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba66,ESTP,as an intern it's very different you're
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba67,ESTP,only there for usually four months at a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba68,ESTP,time it's just a different mindset a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba69,ESTP,different expectation but when you are
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba70,ESTP,out and about in the full-time real
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba71,ESTP,world impostor syndrome hit me
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba72,ESTP,personally really quickly one
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba73,ESTP,I didn't study software engineering or
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba74,ESTP,computer science in university I had a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba75,ESTP,chemical engineering degree - I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba76,ESTP,immediately got paired up with someone
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba77,ESTP,who was of the same age as me just out
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba78,ESTP,of school and they were just so much
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba79,ESTP,faster so much better it seemed to me
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba80,ESTP,they were so much better at everything
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba81,ESTP,than I was that the comparison was just
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba82,ESTP,inevitable I constantly compared myself
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba83,ESTP,to my partner that I worked with on a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba84,ESTP,project that constantly compared myself
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba85,ESTP,to others and I actually was feeling
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba86,ESTP,pretty bad at that point of time because
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba87,ESTP,I really thought that you know maybe
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba88,ESTP,software engineering is not for me I'm
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba89,ESTP,not as good as so many other people a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba90,ESTP,lot of people coded since they were like
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba91,ESTP,seven years old or five years old or
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba92,ESTP,whatever and I didn't even study this at
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba93,ESTP,school and I just felt kind of
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba94,ESTP,unqualified for the job I was like why
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba95,ESTP,am I even hired like why am I here but
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba96,ESTP,in reality you know impostor syndrome is
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba97,ESTP,so common in the tech industry
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba98,ESTP,especially amongst I don't want to say
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba99,ESTP,special amongst women because I don't
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba100,ESTP,want to single out the gender but I just
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba101,ESTP,know that it's very common with all the
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba102,ESTP,gender stereotypes because as women
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba103,ESTP,especially considering how
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba104,ESTP,male-dominated the industry is and there
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba105,ESTP,are certain male skills that are being
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba106,ESTP,elevated you just feel like oh I don't
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba107,ESTP,have this or this doesn't come naturally
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba108,ESTP,to me and you start just feeling bad
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba109,ESTP,about yourself and you start feeling
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba110,ESTP,unqualified for me personally I dealt
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba111,ESTP,with it by really you know encouraging
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba112,ESTP,myself mental and internal in thinking
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba113,ESTP,that you know I was hired for a reason
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba114,ESTP,and people around me do think that I'm
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba115,ESTP,good and I need to think about the same
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba116,ESTP,thing about myself and I had a really
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba117,ESTP,good circle of friends and people who
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba118,ESTP,would also talk to me and encouraged me
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba119,ESTP,and that really helped me get over my
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba120,ESTP,imposter but even now I still sometimes
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba121,ESTP,face the same kind of mindset and
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba122,ESTP,problem of oh I don't know as much as
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba123,ESTP,this other person does or maybe this
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba124,ESTP,specific field I should have studied
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba125,ESTP,more deeply and again that's totally
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba126,ESTP,normal so what I wish I knew again is
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba127,ESTP,that I would feel this way so that I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba128,ESTP,could be mentally prepared for how to
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba129,ESTP,deal with it so impostor syndrome is
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba130,ESTP,definitely 100
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba131,ESTP,reowww and then last but not least I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba132,ESTP,also want to say that I wish I knew how
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba133,ESTP,collaborative software engineering was
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba134,ESTP,you know there is this big stereotype
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba135,ESTP,around oh if you're a software engineer
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba136,ESTP,you're just sitting somewhere in a
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba137,ESTP,corner you're not talking to any people
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba138,ESTP,you're just there coding really quietly
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba139,ESTP,and like most of your day is just lonely
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba140,ESTP,but in reality the role of a software
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba141,ESTP,engineer is extremely collaborative
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba142,ESTP,because you're constantly interacting
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba143,ESTP,with designers with product managers and
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba144,ESTP,at the end of the day with other
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba145,ESTP,engineers too because in the end of the
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba146,ESTP,day you're probably not gonna be the
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba147,ESTP,only person on the project not the only
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba148,ESTP,person on the team and you constantly
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba149,ESTP,need to know bounce ideas off of other
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba150,ESTP,people and in my other videos around
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba151,ESTP,lessons that I learned as a software
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba152,ESTP,engineer I'm talking also about project
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba153,ESTP,management and the software skills of
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba154,ESTP,being a software engineer and that's
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba155,ESTP,that's definitely a huge part that I
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba156,ESTP,feel like people don't really get
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba157,ESTP,exposed to while they're in school or
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba158,ESTP,while they're fantasizing about you know
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba159,ESTP,what a role of a programmer in a company
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba160,ESTP,is and in reality it is a super
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba161,ESTP,collaborative role yes maybe it's not as
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba162,ESTP,social as being I don't know marketing
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba163,ESTP,manager or is being a product manager
ESTP_THINGS I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming | Life of Luba164,ESTP,even but you still have to have good

talk about what it's"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan2",ISTP,"like to work as a lawyer,
or an investment banker,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan3",ISTP,"on transactions,
corporate transactions."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan4",ISTP,"And I'm going to split the
talk into two parts, mainly"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan5",ISTP,the second part.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan6",ISTP,"The first part, I'll
spend a little bit of time"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan7",ISTP,"on why it's exciting to
work on transactions,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan8",ISTP,why it's exciting to do deals.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan9",ISTP,"And then the second part
will be on the skills"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan10",ISTP,"that I think are necessary
to do this job well."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan11",ISTP,OK?
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan12",ISTP,"So first part, why I think
it's exciting to work"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan13",ISTP,on transactions.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan14",ISTP,"There are three
reasons, I think."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan15",ISTP,"The first is what you're
working on is important."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan16",ISTP,"So you're hired by
the CEO of a company"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan17",ISTP,"to advise them on taking
the company public"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan18",ISTP,"or on selling the company
or on buying another company"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan19",ISTP,"or merging their company
with another company."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan20",ISTP,"That is, by definition,
very important to the CEO."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan21",ISTP,"It's probably the most important
matter the CEO has ever"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan22",ISTP,come across professionally.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan23",ISTP,So it's important.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan24",ISTP,"And secondly, you can help."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan25",ISTP,"You're being hired because
you have some expertise,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan26",ISTP,"because you know something that
the CEO doesn't know or doesn't"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan27",ISTP,have.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan28",ISTP,"He does not have the
expertise that you have."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan29",ISTP,"So I think it's exciting
because it's important"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan30",ISTP,"and because you can
make a difference."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan31",ISTP,"The second reason I
think the job is exciting"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan32",ISTP,is because it's dynamic.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan33",ISTP,Every deal is different.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan34",ISTP,"Even within a deal,
the deal changes."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan35",ISTP,"It morphs over time as
the deal progresses."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan36",ISTP,"So when you work
on a transaction,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan37",ISTP,"you're constantly confronted
with new challenges,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan38",ISTP,with new issues.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan39",ISTP,"And then from deal to deal,
they're entirely different."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan40",ISTP,The people are different.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan41",ISTP,The companies are different.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan42",ISTP,So it never gets old.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan43",ISTP,It never gets boring.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan44",ISTP,I think that's fun.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan45",ISTP,"So it's exciting
because it's dynamic."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan46",ISTP,Every transaction is different.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan47",ISTP,That's atypical for jobs.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan48",ISTP,"Typically, a job becomes
somewhat routine over time"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan49",ISTP,and can become somewhat boring.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan50",ISTP,"Not true on deals because
every deal is so different."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan51",ISTP,"Third reason I
think it's exciting"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan52",ISTP,is because it's intense.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan53",ISTP,"You are going to
spend a lot of time"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan54",ISTP,"and a lot of energy
working on transactions,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan55",ISTP,"if you become an investment
banker or a corporate lawyer."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan56",ISTP,"You're going to be sequestered
in conference rooms"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan57",ISTP,with your clients.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan58",ISTP,"And you're going to get
to know them very well."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan59",ISTP,"And you're going
to work very hard."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan60",ISTP,And that's not always fun.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan61",ISTP,"But it's mostly fun, I think."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan62",ISTP,"And in hindsight, when
you look back on it,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan63",ISTP,you'll appreciate that it's fun.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan64",ISTP,"But it's exciting
because it's so intense."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan65",ISTP,"So I think the job is exciting
because it's important."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan66",ISTP,"What you're working
on is important."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan67",ISTP,And you can make a difference.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan68",ISTP,Because it's dynamic.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan69",ISTP,"It changes from deal to
deal and even within a deal."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan70",ISTP,And because it's very intense.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan71",ISTP,"So what skills do I think are
necessary to do the job well?"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan72",ISTP,"I think there are
six tangible skills"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan73",ISTP,"that I believe are
necessary, and then four"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan74",ISTP,intangible skills.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan75",ISTP,"The six tangible skills start
with interpersonal skills."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan76",ISTP,"You need to have strong
interpersonal skills."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan77",ISTP,"Now, I don't mean that in
the sense that some of you"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan78",ISTP,"may think in this room or people
outside of this room may think."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan79",ISTP,"I don't mean
interpersonal skills"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan80",ISTP,"in the sense of sort of slap
you on the back salesman"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan81",ISTP,or saleswoman types of skills.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan82",ISTP,I don't mean schmoozing skills.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan83",ISTP,"I mean the ability to
convey to the client"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan84",ISTP,"that they should have confidence
in you, that you are competent."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan85",ISTP,"And that they should
have confidence in you."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan86",ISTP,"Secondly, quantitative skills."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan87",ISTP,"Quantitative skills
are important if you're"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan88",ISTP,going to work on transactions.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan89",ISTP,"Now, you do not need to have
been a math major or a physics"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan90",ISTP,"major or an engineer
in college to have"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan91",ISTP,"the prerequisite
quantitative skills."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan92",ISTP,"But you need to be
facile with numbers."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan93",ISTP,"You need to be
comfortable with numbers."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan94",ISTP,"Because much of what you
do as a transaction lawyer"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan95",ISTP,"and definitely as an
investment banker will involve"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan96",ISTP,numbers and numerical analysis.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan97",ISTP,"So you need to be comfortable
working with numbers."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan98",ISTP,"Thirdly, you have to have
an interest in business."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan99",ISTP,"You do not, contrary
to popular belief,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan100",ISTP,"need to have a
business background."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan101",ISTP,"You do not need to have worked
in business for four, five,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan102",ISTP,"or three, or two, or one year."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan103",ISTP,"But you should have an
interest in business."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan104",ISTP,"And the way I would say you
could manifest that interest"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan105",ISTP,"now, or what you might
want to be doing now"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan106",ISTP,"at this stage of
your careers, is just"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan107",ISTP,"The Wall Street Journal
a couple of times a week,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan108",ISTP,"not even everyday, just
a couple of times a week,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan109",ISTP,"just the front page,
just the front page."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan110",ISTP,"So take 10 minutes,
that's all it"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan111",ISTP,"takes to read the front page
of The Wall Street Journal"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan112",ISTP,two or three days a week.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan113",ISTP,"And you'll become familiar with
what's going on economically"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan114",ISTP,"around the world
and what's going"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan115",ISTP,"on among some of the leading
companies around the world."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan116",ISTP,"So develop an interest,
acquire an interest,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan117",ISTP,fake an interest in business.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan118",ISTP,"But you know, have an interest,
at least, in business."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan119",ISTP,"Fourthly, you need
to be discreet."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan120",ISTP,"You will be entrusted with
confidential information that's"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan121",ISTP,"very, very valuable."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan122",ISTP,"And you don't want to
be the person who's"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan123",ISTP,"talking about the transaction
upon which they are working"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan124",ISTP,"when they're on a train,
or in an elevator,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan125",ISTP,or at a restaurant.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan126",ISTP,"You do not want to be divulging
this confidential information."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan127",ISTP,You need to be discreet.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan128",ISTP,"You need to treat
it with discretion."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan129",ISTP,"And you need to
exercise good judgment."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan130",ISTP,"Next, you need to be
OK with confrontation."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan131",ISTP,"A popular misconception that
some people in law school"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan132",ISTP,"have is they think of litigators
as sort of conflict seekers."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan133",ISTP,"And they think of transactional
lawyers, or corporate lawyers,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan134",ISTP,"as the people who want
to avoid conflict."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan135",ISTP,"You do not get to avoid conflict
by becoming a corporate lawyer"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan136",ISTP,or an investment banker.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan137",ISTP,"You're going to work
on a transaction."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan138",ISTP,"The people sitting on the other
side of the table from you"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan139",ISTP,"have adverse interests
to those of your client."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan140",ISTP,"And you're going to have to
conflict with that person."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan141",ISTP,"You're going to have to
negotiate against that person."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan142",ISTP,"And you're going
to have conflict."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan143",ISTP,So you have to be OK with that.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan144",ISTP,You have to be OK with conflict.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan145",ISTP,"Last tangible skill
is you need to be"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan146",ISTP,able to put the client first.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan147",ISTP,A lot of people say that.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan148",ISTP,What does that really mean?
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan149",ISTP,"It means that you need to
be there for the client"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan150",ISTP,whenever they need you.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan151",ISTP,"You need to respond to
their emails immediately."

immediately when they call you."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan153",ISTP,"One, you want to really be
responsive to the client."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan154",ISTP,"But two, you want to
just as importantly,"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan155",ISTP,"convey to the client
that they are a priority."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan156",ISTP,"So you're going to get calls at
2:00, 3:00 4:00 in the morning."

top of that, whatever"

feel comfortable that they"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan163",ISTP,are a priority for you.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan164",ISTP,"So those are the
six tangible skills"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan165",ISTP,"that I would say are
necessary to do deals"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan166",ISTP,"or to work on
corporate transactions."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan167",ISTP,"Four intangible
skills, the first"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan168",ISTP,"is it's helpful to be an
open book, or a blank sheet"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan169",ISTP,"of paper, whatever analogy you
want to use to convey what I'm"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan170",ISTP,"trying to convey, which is that
you want to be a student when"

out on this career"
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan172",ISTP,"as a transactional lawyer

"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan173",ISTP,"You want to find somebody who
does this job really well."

study that person."

learn as much as you can"

student of the business"

"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan179",ISTP,"I can't tell you how many
people make this mistake."

preconceived notions"

good or bad at doing deals."
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan182",ISTP,And they're usually wrong.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan183",ISTP,And you can't do that.
"ISTP_""Are You Destined to Deal?"" With Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jim Donovan184",ISTP,"You need to put aside
any preconceived notions"

"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself7",ISTJc,like well I mean you can see where my
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself8",ISTJc,hair line is and I had like a little bit
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself9",ISTJc,of hair kind of like did I do this with
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself10",ISTJc,and then you turn my head to be all thin
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself11",ISTJc,up here looks like I'm not trying to
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself12",ISTJc,hide anything anyways so I'm about to go

"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself16",ISTJc,I'm really passionate about it right now
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself17",ISTJc,so hopefully I can take this philosophy
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself18",ISTJc,going forward and that is the idea that
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself19",ISTJc,self-improvement is not everything I
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself20",ISTJc,used to spend so much time reading
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself21",ISTJc,self-improvement books subscribing to
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself22",ISTJc,self-improvement YouTube channels
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself23",ISTJc,self-improvement subreddits and it was
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself24",ISTJc,stressful to be honest with you I was
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself25",ISTJc,not fulfilled I started to ask myself
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself26",ISTJc,how come I can spend so much time on
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself27",ISTJc,self-improvement books and subreddits
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself28",ISTJc,and videos yet still not be totally
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself29",ISTJc,satisfied like how come I don't have
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself30",ISTJc,much of a social life how come I'm not
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself31",ISTJc,doing perfectly in school etc etc I had
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself32",ISTJc,to go through this I'm like what gives
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself33",ISTJc,I'm pouring so much time into
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself34",ISTJc,self-improvement yet nothing is really
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself35",ISTJc,changing I'm not really like much better
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself36",ISTJc,off then I started to realize that I'm
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself37",ISTJc,not really doing anything like what I'm
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself38",ISTJc,reading self-improvement books like like
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself39",ISTJc,what am i doing real like what is that
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself40",ISTJc,accomplishing all these self-improvement
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself41",ISTJc,books talk about how to do things better
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself42",ISTJc,but if all you're doing is reading the
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself43",ISTJc,book instead of actually like reading it
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself44",ISTJc,and then applying it by doing things
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself45",ISTJc,you're not better off at all I'd read
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself46",ISTJc,are slash productivity all these
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself47",ISTJc,productivity tips would be up there how
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself48",ISTJc,to organize your Google Drive how to you
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself49",ISTJc,know make sure you're productive early
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself50",ISTJc,in the morning and I would I'd read and
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself51",ISTJc,read and read but I wasn't really doing
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself52",ISTJc,anything I did not take that advice and
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself53",ISTJc,then apply it to real life
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself54",ISTJc,self-improvement and productivity was my
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself55",ISTJc,hobby I wasn't actually like improving
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself56",ISTJc,the actual things in my life and living
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself57",ISTJc,those things
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself58",ISTJc,and I wasn't actually being productive
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself59",ISTJc,in those things I was just obsessing
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself60",ISTJc,over being productive and obsessing over
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself61",ISTJc,self-improvement instead of just living
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself62",ISTJc,so the point I'm trying to get at is if
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself63",ISTJc,self-improvement is your main hobby
"ISTJc_Why you should stop ""improving"" yourself64",ISTJc,honestly get a better hobby don't ditch

ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)104,ISTJc,life let me just keep a note of them the
ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)105,ISTJc,second way I do that is by doing a

ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)119,ISTJc,notebook in Evernote and it just says
ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)120,ISTJc,five years from today now I don't really
ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)121,ISTJc,stick with that idea of five years from
ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)122,ISTJc,today but the point for me is where do I
ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)123,ISTJc,want to go in what direction it could be
ISTJc_How to Design Your Life (My Process For Achieving Goals)124,ISTJc,as simple as moving like I know I'm

ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming4,ENTJ,weird so I personally love this format a
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming5,ENTJ,video because I feel like it can be very
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming6,ENTJ,helpful I mean we all have these things
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming7,ENTJ,that we wish we could go back in time
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming8,ENTJ,and change and do differently and since
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming9,ENTJ,we cannot change our own past these
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming10,ENTJ,videos might be a way to kind of help
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming11,ENTJ,change someone else's future or at least
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming12,ENTJ,help them avoid the same mistakes that

ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming14,ENTJ,knew when I started programming it's not
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming15,ENTJ,too late to learn to code this is
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming16,ENTJ,something that I feel like is the most
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming17,ENTJ,common misconception when it comes to
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming18,ENTJ,programming and I have this
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming19,ENTJ,misconception as well and that is that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming20,ENTJ,you need to start it when you like five
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming21,ENTJ,years old in order to become a
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming22,ENTJ,programmer or you need to be like a
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming23,ENTJ,gamer or super into computers none of
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming24,ENTJ,the above are true and none of the above
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming25,ENTJ,fit the description of me I play video
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming26,ENTJ,games maybe once every five months and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming27,ENTJ,in my group of friends I would have been
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming28,ENTJ,described as like the grandpa when it
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming29,ENTJ,comes to understanding how to do things
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming30,ENTJ,with the computer
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming31,ENTJ,so I really wish I would have known that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming32,ENTJ,it really isn't that difficult it's not
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming33,ENTJ,magic and you can learn it learn the
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming34,ENTJ,basics this one would have saved me so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming35,ENTJ,much time if I would have known it the
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming36,ENTJ,thing is that I got started trying to
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming37,ENTJ,build an app from like zero knowledge of
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming38,ENTJ,how any of this worked I had no clue
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming39,ENTJ,what programming was and at that point I
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming40,ENTJ,would have thought that programming was
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming41,ENTJ,like writing ones and zeros so I
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming42,ENTJ,literally had no clue so getting started
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming43,ENTJ,in that way meant that I was able to
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming44,ENTJ,build some things but it was with like
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming45,ENTJ,immense amount of effort and I wish that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming46,ENTJ,someone would have just told me that if
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming47,ENTJ,you just learn some basics of
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming48,ENTJ,object-oriented programming then you're
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming49,ENTJ,probably going to be able to cut your
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming50,ENTJ,time spent on this in half I mean I feel
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming51,ENTJ,like I wouldn't have listened but if I
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming52,ENTJ,would have listened it would have been a
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming53,ENTJ,tremendous help and we're only talking
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming54,ENTJ,about spending one or two hours per day
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming55,ENTJ,for maybe two weeks trying to learn like
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming56,ENTJ,the very basics and if you do that then
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming57,ENTJ,you'll become an infinitely more capable
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming58,ENTJ,programmer and for most of the stuff
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming59,ENTJ,that I build on this channel I still
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming60,ENTJ,rely pretty much entirely on this very
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming61,ENTJ,basic programming knowledge and I'll add
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming62,ENTJ,a link in the description of this video
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming63,ENTJ,to a good article that I found on the
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming64,ENTJ,basics of programming and I'll also add
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming65,ENTJ,a link to my favorite book for learning
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming66,ENTJ,the fundamentals of programming it
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming67,ENTJ,doesn't matter what language you choose
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming68,ENTJ,just pick one
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming69,ENTJ,all right so this one is a bit funny in
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming70,ENTJ,a sense because I spent so much time
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming71,ENTJ,trying to figure out which language to
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming72,ENTJ,juice and trying to look at which
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming73,ENTJ,language would be least likely to die or
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming74,ENTJ,become like obsolete in a few years and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming75,ENTJ,what's funny about it is I now realize
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming76,ENTJ,that it would not have mattered which
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming77,ENTJ,one I picked because they're all so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming78,ENTJ,similar that you won't really have any
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming79,ENTJ,trouble switching to another language in
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming80,ENTJ,case that your language were to like die
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming81,ENTJ,out completely and also very few
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming82,ENTJ,languages if any actually die out
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming83,ENTJ,completely especially if you look at the
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming84,ENTJ,big ones and even if you were to be
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming85,ENTJ,super unlucky and your programming
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming86,ENTJ,language was to die out and no new
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming87,ENTJ,programs are written in it they'll still
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming88,ENTJ,be a ton of old programs that still need
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming89,ENTJ,maintenance and update
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming90,ENTJ,that are written in your favorite
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming91,ENTJ,language so it really doesn't matter
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming92,ENTJ,which one you pick as long as you're
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming93,ENTJ,excited about the language and as long
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming94,ENTJ,as you have like project ideas and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming95,ENTJ,things you're excited to work on and in
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming96,ENTJ,case you're having like decision anxiety
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming97,ENTJ,about which language to choose I thought
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming98,ENTJ,I'd just add my recommendation so that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming99,ENTJ,you have that at least so I would
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming100,ENTJ,recommend you learn Java because it's
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming101,ENTJ,really easy to learn and it's also easy
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming102,ENTJ,to transfer knowledge from Java to other
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming103,ENTJ,languages and there's also tons of
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming104,ENTJ,resources available to learn from don't
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming105,ENTJ,buy that udemy course you're better off
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming106,ENTJ,learning it for free okay I have nothing
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming107,ENTJ,against udemy or any other sites for
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming108,ENTJ,learning they're probably great but
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming109,ENTJ,something that I wish I would have known
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming110,ENTJ,before I bought a udemy course on iOS
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming111,ENTJ,development is that I would have needed
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming112,ENTJ,a lot more basic programming knowledge
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming113,ENTJ,to actually utilize that course fully
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming114,ENTJ,and the course that I bought was a
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming115,ENTJ,course that in my opinion was trying to
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming116,ENTJ,do too much it was trying to take you
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming117,ENTJ,from like zero programming knowledge to
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming118,ENTJ,a full-blown iOS app that was like
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming119,ENTJ,integrating an API and using source
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming120,ENTJ,control with github and basically they
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming121,ENTJ,went over the basics way too quickly so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming122,ENTJ,I was not able to follow along and that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming123,ENTJ,just ended up leaving me feeling like
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming124,ENTJ,the task of learning this was just too
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming125,ENTJ,difficult there are probably better
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming126,ENTJ,courses on udemy and maybe this one was
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming127,ENTJ,great too and I'm just a bit slow who
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming128,ENTJ,knows
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming129,ENTJ,either way I believe that most people
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming130,ENTJ,are probably going to be better off just
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming131,ENTJ,learning on their own and just googling
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming132,ENTJ,their way to the answers of the
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming133,ENTJ,questions that come up and the second
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming134,ENTJ,benefit of learning that way is that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming135,ENTJ,you're actually practicing being in a
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming136,ENTJ,programmer because that's mostly what
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming137,ENTJ,programmers do they run into problems
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming138,ENTJ,they're unable to solve and then they
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming139,ENTJ,Google their way to the answers learning
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming140,ENTJ,it it's not as difficult as you think
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming141,ENTJ,you get to something that I know scares
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming142,ENTJ,a lot of people and get scared me to the
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming143,ENTJ,terminal also scared me and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming144,ENTJ,I believe the reason for this is that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming145,ENTJ,we're so unfamiliar with this way of
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming146,ENTJ,like interacting with the computer
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming147,ENTJ,however that's not strange and it might
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming148,ENTJ,feel daunting and uncomfortable but it
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming149,ENTJ,really doesn't take too long until you
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming150,ENTJ,understand it to the point of actually
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming151,ENTJ,being able to use it it's just about
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming152,ENTJ,spending time in this environment so I'd
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming153,ENTJ,recommend spending some time in here
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming154,ENTJ,every day so in the terminal for Mac or
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming155,ENTJ,console for Windows and just learn to
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming156,ENTJ,navigate learn to create new files and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming157,ENTJ,new folders and just get familiar with
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming158,ENTJ,the environment and then learn get so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming159,ENTJ,gift is a source control system that's
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming160,ENTJ,widely used by software developers and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming161,ENTJ,basically what it allows you to do is
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming162,ENTJ,save your local code to a database which
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming163,ENTJ,in my case is github.com and that means
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming164,ENTJ,that if I lose the code that I have on
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming165,ENTJ,my computer it will be stored on
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming166,ENTJ,github.com and I can get it back and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming167,ENTJ,continue working from the last point
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming168,ENTJ,where I saved and it does a lot more
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming169,ENTJ,than this but for now that's not really
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming170,ENTJ,important take breaks this is something
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming171,ENTJ,I still struggle with but it's super
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming172,ENTJ,important and currently I try not to sit
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming173,ENTJ,and code for more than three hours
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming174,ENTJ,without a break and that break will be
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming175,ENTJ,to eat and then maybe either go for a
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming176,ENTJ,walk or go to the gym so why is this so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming177,ENTJ,important well the reason that is so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming178,ENTJ,important it's also kind of the reason
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming179,ENTJ,why it's so difficult to actually do so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming180,ENTJ,basically when you take a break you
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming181,ENTJ,clear your head which means you'll be
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming182,ENTJ,more able to solve the problems that
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming183,ENTJ,you'll run into when you're coding and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming184,ENTJ,usually when you need to take a break
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming185,ENTJ,you're stuck on a problem that you feel
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming186,ENTJ,like you're just about to solve and so
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming187,ENTJ,you kind of postpone the break for just
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming188,ENTJ,another 10 minutes and then all the
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming189,ENTJ,sudden the time just starts running away
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming190,ENTJ,from you and the problem that you
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming191,ENTJ,thought you were gonna solve in the next
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming192,ENTJ,10 minutes is taking you four hours and
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming193,ENTJ,you still haven't solved it at least
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming194,ENTJ,that's the reason why it's so difficult
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming195,ENTJ,for me to take that break because I
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming196,ENTJ,constantly feel like I'm just ten
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming197,ENTJ,minutes away from solving that problem
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming198,ENTJ,and you can always postpone a break for
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming199,ENTJ,just 10 minutes right 10 minutes is like
ENTJ_6 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming200,ENTJ,nothing and I always feel like if I just
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type0,ESTPc,hello everybody welcome back to a Sarah
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type1,ESTPc,site I'm a Sarah and this is a bit of a
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type2,ESTPc,new format for me but I really just
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type3,ESTPc,wanted to try recording like this to see
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type4,ESTPc,how it would turn out and we're just
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type5,ESTPc,gonna get right into it so today we're
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type6,ESTPc,discussing five myths surrounding the
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type7,ESTPc,INTJ personality type and if you've been
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type8,ESTPc,in the MBTI community for you've been a
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type9,ESTPc,little while you'll have heard most of
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type10,ESTPc,these because the INTJ has a lot of
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type11,ESTPc,stereotypes surrounding them being one
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type12,ESTPc,of the two rarer types alongside the
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type13,ESTPc,infj so the first myth we're going to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type14,ESTPc,discuss today is that INTJs are
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type15,ESTPc,judgmental or mean and people tend to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type16,ESTPc,think of this because they see the j at
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type17,ESTPc,the end of the INTJ personality type and
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type18,ESTPc,they go judging or J judging judgmental
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type19,ESTPc,and this really isn't the case because
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type20,ESTPc,as an INTJ an introverted type they lead
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type21,ESTPc,with their introverted function which is
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type22,ESTPc,intuition
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type23,ESTPc,INTJs are dominant introverted
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type24,ESTPc,perceivers who prefer to shape their
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type25,ESTPc,external world via judging second to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type26,ESTPc,their introverted perceptions what this
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type27,ESTPc,essentially means is that INTJs tend to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type28,ESTPc,be actually far less judgmental than
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type29,ESTPc,their INTP or ENTJ thinking brethren and
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type30,ESTPc,INTP is likely to judge something as
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type31,ESTPc,mediately as it comes to them because
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type32,ESTPc,they lead with that judging function and
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type33,ESTPc,ENTJ is far more so because they leaked
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type34,ESTPc,an extroverted thinking or extrovert of
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type35,ESTPc,judging function
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type36,ESTPc,INTJs are likely to perceive something
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type37,ESTPc,first process it a little bit and then
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type38,ESTPc,judge it so the second myth we're going
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type39,ESTPc,to discuss today is that
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type40,ESTPc,INTJs are bad at reading people and this
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type41,ESTPc,one is true and untrue because INTJs
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type42,ESTPc,aren't bad at reading people as dominant
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type43,ESTPc,introverted intuitive z' they actually
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type44,ESTPc,tend to be extremely good at reading
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type45,ESTPc,people it's one of the reasons that
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type46,ESTPc,you're not likely to be able to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type47,ESTPc,manipulate 9tj INTJs are bad at
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type48,ESTPc,responding to social situations because
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type49,ESTPc,they don't have that extraverted feeling
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type50,ESTPc,that the infj has they are likely to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type51,ESTPc,only respond to situations that interest
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type52,ESTPc,them in their field of thinking or
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type53,ESTPc,intuition if you can spark either of
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type54,ESTPc,those you're likely to get a lot of
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type55,ESTPc,communication and discussion out of the
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type56,ESTPc,INTJ
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type57,ESTPc,but if you approach an INTJ with normal
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type58,ESTPc,social situation things like small talk
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type59,ESTPc,feelings they're not likely going to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type60,ESTPc,respond and are likely not even going to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type61,ESTPc,know how to respond because they don't
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type62,ESTPc,like to do those things
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type63,ESTPc,or deal with those types of situations
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type64,ESTPc,so to summarize the INTJ isn't bad at
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type65,ESTPc,reading people they're quite good at
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type66,ESTPc,reading people they're just sort of bad
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type67,ESTPc,responding in ways that most people
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type68,ESTPc,would see is socially normal so the
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type69,ESTPc,third myth is that INTJs don't have
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type70,ESTPc,feelings and this is an easy one to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type71,ESTPc,disprove of course because everybody has
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type72,ESTPc,feelings the INTJ though is the least
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type73,ESTPc,likely type in my opinion to be
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type74,ESTPc,expressive about their feelings and this
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type75,ESTPc,is what leads people to think that they
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type76,ESTPc,don't have feelings I would say that
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type77,ESTPc,INTJ is just like everybody else have a
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type78,ESTPc,fair amount of feeling in their life
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type79,ESTPc,they just don't express it in ways that
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type80,ESTPc,other people do and the reason for this
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type81,ESTPc,is because that introverted feeling is
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type82,ESTPc,in the tertiary function slot
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type83,ESTPc,it is neither antagonistic or supportive
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type84,ESTPc,to dominant introverted intuition think
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type85,ESTPc,of the INTP who leads with dominant
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type86,ESTPc,introverted thinking they have repressed
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type87,ESTPc,feeling if you get an INTP into a
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type88,ESTPc,stressful situation they're likely to
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type89,ESTPc,respond with that feeling function this
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type90,ESTPc,isn't true with the INTJ next myth is
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type91,ESTPc,that INTJs are highly organised and this
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type92,ESTPc,one is true in a sense but it's that
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type93,ESTPc,INTJs has dominant perceiving types
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type94,ESTPc,aren't as organized as you think they
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type95,ESTPc,are
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type96,ESTPc,INTJs tend to be very laid-back and
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type97,ESTPc,relaxed they tend to be very open to new
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type98,ESTPc,situations and scenarios but they also
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type99,ESTPc,judge and shape their external world
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type100,ESTPc,just as much as they need to to make
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type101,ESTPc,sure that their introverted intuition
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type102,ESTPc,can do what it needs to do for example I
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type103,ESTPc,don't keep a calendar I don't write down
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type104,ESTPc,important dates I keep it all in my head
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type105,ESTPc,everything is up here but I get things
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type106,ESTPc,done when they need to be done I never
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type107,ESTPc,submit schoolwork late I'm never late to

ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type135,ESTPc,as they need to be for them to function
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type136,ESTPc,in a proper efficient manner so the last
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type137,ESTPc,myth we're going to discuss today is
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type138,ESTPc,that INTJs are know-it-alls or stubborn
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type139,ESTPc,and I don't think this one is true

ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type142,ESTPc,intuitive types they lead with that
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type143,ESTPc,intuition an intuition is highly
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type144,ESTPc,correlated with Big Five openness which

ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type152,ESTPc,new I don't have time to waste when it
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type153,ESTPc,comes to being wrong about something or
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type154,ESTPc,defending my ego around situations like
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type155,ESTPc,that I want to learn something new and
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type156,ESTPc,move on and make it better and I think
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type157,ESTPc,people tend to miss interpret the INTJ
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type158,ESTPc,because INTJs are likely to be stubborn
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type159,ESTPc,if you come to them with something that

ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type165,ESTPc,they're likely to push back on your
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type166,ESTPc,ideas because INTJs as introverted
ESTPc_5 Myths about the INTJ Personality Type167,ESTPc,intuitive czar likely to think very far

ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...23,ESFJc,what normal youtubers do instead of just
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...24,ESFJc,you know upsetting their subscribers and
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...25,ESFJc,making them comment like where are you
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...26,ESFJc,haven't you been posting but do you know
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...27,ESFJc,me I like to go against the grain and by
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...28,ESFJc,that I mean go against what you should
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...29,ESFJc,do in order to maintain your YouTube
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...30,ESFJc,channel but that's okay because there's
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...31,ESFJc,still quite a handful of you that are
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...32,ESFJc,still here and I'm I actually very much
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...33,ESFJc,so appreciate that very much so a pre I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...34,ESFJc,actually very I actually I appreciate
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...35,ESFJc,you guys and that's why I felt the need
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...36,ESFJc,to kind of explain myself in this video
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...37,ESFJc,for those of you that don't know I had
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...38,ESFJc,been making videos for a long time on
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...39,ESFJc,YouTube since 2006 about 13 years you
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...40,ESFJc,know I started in a time where you could
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...41,ESFJc,not make money off of YouTube and the
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...42,ESFJc,videos I started off doing a really
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...43,ESFJc,crappy you know so for me the fun part
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...44,ESFJc,was always just trying to get better
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...45,ESFJc,than the last video and just keep
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...46,ESFJc,improving and draw more fans to you and
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...47,ESFJc,see what you can do to be better and
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...48,ESFJc,essentially just make better content
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...49,ESFJc,because the better your content was I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...50,ESFJc,mean the more YouTube would promote it
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...51,ESFJc,and that kind of just fit with my motto
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...52,ESFJc,of always wanting to improve and make
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...53,ESFJc,something better than the last video
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...54,ESFJc,that was always my goal but in the past
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...55,ESFJc,five or six years YouTube changed that a
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...56,ESFJc,lot and maybe it was even earlier than
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...57,ESFJc,that YouTube's algorithm change and
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...58,ESFJc,basically it became about watch time so
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...59,ESFJc,you wanted to make longer videos
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...60,ESFJc,and you wanted people to be watching
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...61,ESFJc,them all the way through and for the
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...62,ESFJc,longest time I tried to fight that
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...63,ESFJc,system and I always believed that you
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...64,ESFJc,know you should focus on quality and not
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...65,ESFJc,quantity even though that the sacrifice
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...66,ESFJc,you know a whole month of not posting
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...67,ESFJc,videos which will take a hit on your bun
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...68,ESFJc,your buns there's no other way to
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...69,ESFJc,describe that just snorted a little bit
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...70,ESFJc,but no other way to describe it it would
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...71,ESFJc,take a hit on your income because you're
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...72,ESFJc,not posting obviously less people are
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...73,ESFJc,watching your other videos as well and
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...74,ESFJc,for me I was actually okay with that
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...75,ESFJc,because like I said it was never really
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...76,ESFJc,about the numbers and stuff I just the
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...77,ESFJc,thing I really cared about was putting
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...78,ESFJc,out good content and stuff that I was
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...79,ESFJc,excited and happy to make you know me
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...80,ESFJc,and the guys were working on it we were
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...81,ESFJc,happy about it we didn't necessarily
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...82,ESFJc,care as long as you know a decent amount
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...83,ESFJc,of use or I could still pay everyone it
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...84,ESFJc,worked but over time as I kept trying to
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...85,ESFJc,do that the videos got crazier that
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...86,ESFJc,times it took to make it got longer I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...87,ESFJc,don't know I don't even know when
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...88,ESFJc,exactly it started to happen but I was
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...89,ESFJc,subconsciously I think getting a little
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...90,ESFJc,frustrated with YouTube and getting
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...91,ESFJc,getting really just bitter I guess with
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...92,ESFJc,how what what YouTube had become seeing
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...93,ESFJc,the kind of content that was suddenly at
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...94,ESFJc,the top of the food chain that I mean I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...95,ESFJc,have nothing against you know when all
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...96,ESFJc,the dish traps and stuff was happening I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...97,ESFJc,actually it was one of the people who
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...98,ESFJc,said I don't blame them at all they're
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...99,ESFJc,actually doing what's what's what you
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...100,ESFJc,should be doing for your career that's
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...101,ESFJc,smart if I was a smart businessperson I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...102,ESFJc,probably would have followed that trend
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...103,ESFJc,I am NOT I go against the grain but
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...104,ESFJc,anyway I'm getting a little off track
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...105,ESFJc,essentially to make this long story a
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...106,ESFJc,little bit shorter I was getting
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...107,ESFJc,frustrated with the way YouTube had
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...108,ESFJc,become and I guess I don't know when it
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...109,ESFJc,started to happen but I started to I had
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...110,ESFJc,a I got a very bad attitude having the
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...111,ESFJc,hollows to describe it it happened very
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...112,ESFJc,slowly like over time like I don't know
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...113,ESFJc,if you guys know this or not but over
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...114,ESFJc,the past few years I'm not gonna say
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...115,ESFJc,every single video but there's a lot of
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...116,ESFJc,videos in the past few years that I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...117,ESFJc,posted that I knew for a fact could have
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...118,ESFJc,been better it wasn't ready to go out it
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...119,ESFJc,wasn't something I was proud of and I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...120,ESFJc,was not happy about if I wasn't laughing
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...121,ESFJc,at it it wasn't good to me and I was not
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...122,ESFJc,laughing it I would see 90% of the
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...123,ESFJc,videos I posted in the last three years
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...124,ESFJc,and the finding is the ones I really
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...125,ESFJc,liked or the ones that didn't do well
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...126,ESFJc,the ones that I hated did super well
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...127,ESFJc,just because they were the right topic
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...128,ESFJc,or because they had the right like the
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...129,ESFJc,right title or the right thumbnail
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...130,ESFJc,we're soul encouraging they're like oh
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...131,ESFJc,my god right this is so brilliant this
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...132,ESFJc,is so smart I love this oh my god you're
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...133,ESFJc,the only genuine youtuber or whatever
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...134,ESFJc,it's not making funny I'm not making fun
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...135,ESFJc,of you guys I actually really appreciate
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...136,ESFJc,it all I'm saying is I'm trying to
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...137,ESFJc,explain that from my perspective I don't
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...138,ESFJc,know why but I would feel worse because
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...139,ESFJc,I knew that it wasn't I didn't deserve
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...140,ESFJc,it I don't know what see I have some
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...141,ESFJc,psychological issues I don't know what
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...142,ESFJc,that is and I know like I said it sounds
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...143,ESFJc,super first world problem problem me I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...144,ESFJc,mean it is a first world problem but
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...145,ESFJc,it's a real it was a problem for me like
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...146,ESFJc,I said maybe you have mental issues I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...147,ESFJc,don't know what it is
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...148,ESFJc,this is a hard video for me to post I
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...149,ESFJc,know it's not fun or funny it's not what
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...150,ESFJc,you're used to but it it's just more of
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...151,ESFJc,an update and I don't know why I vented
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...152,ESFJc,this to you guys but I felt like for the
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...153,ESFJc,few of you that cared this is the reason
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...154,ESFJc,why the content has changed but again as
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...155,ESFJc,much as I said I haven't think in a
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...156,ESFJc,break from YouTube there has been videos
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...157,ESFJc,that we've been working on if you do is
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...158,ESFJc,that I actually had fun doing here's a
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...159,ESFJc,little little preview of some of them
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...160,ESFJc,coming out I brought back a little bit
ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...161,ESFJc,of cooking but not really oh oh oh do

ESFJc_Why I Haven't Been Posting...174,ESFJc,not a happy cloud it's a little angry

INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)0,INFJ,hello everybody it's Michael Pearce here
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)1,INFJ,happy Columbus Day am I the only one
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)2,INFJ,celebrating it maybe I don't know right
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)3,INFJ,I I think Columbus is fascinating and I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)4,INFJ,want to try to type him and there are
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)5,INFJ,several reasons for this one is because
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)6,INFJ,I kind of want to demonstrate at least
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)7,INFJ,my I don't have really a method of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)8,INFJ,typing I mainly go off of intuition and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)9,INFJ,I will simply present what I've seen of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)10,INFJ,the data and sort of my reasons and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)11,INFJ,leave it in the understanding that I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)12,INFJ,could be completely wrong but also one
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)13,INFJ,of the things that I think is useful to
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)14,INFJ,do is I want to be very clear about
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)15,INFJ,where I am drawing my information from
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)16,INFJ,so that people will know where to look
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)17,INFJ,and will also know what I have not
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)18,INFJ,I'm not factoring in and where to look
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)19,INFJ,to maybe find contradictory evidence one
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)20,INFJ,of the problems with typing is you're
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)21,INFJ,kind of I guess maybe not entirely there
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)22,INFJ,are some ways maybe to introduce some
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)23,INFJ,more falsifiability into the process but
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)24,INFJ,often it kind of amounts to piling up a
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)25,INFJ,lot of excuse me positive evidence like
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)26,INFJ,that they are this type or evidence that
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)27,INFJ,they are not this particular type but
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)28,INFJ,you are still just kind of stockpiling
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)29,INFJ,evidence you're not doing the more
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)30,INFJ,scientific process and that's not really
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)31,INFJ,possible with this sort of thing and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)32,INFJ,that's not just a matter of typing
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)33,INFJ,that's a matter of really anything and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)34,INFJ,the softer Sciences are in humanities I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)35,INFJ,shouldn't say softer Sciences they'd get
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)36,INFJ,angry with me for that but so I I guess
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)37,INFJ,I just sort of wanted to demonstrate at
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)38,INFJ,least me trying to to type someone but
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)39,INFJ,probably more I wanted to just talk
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)40,INFJ,about Columbus so the book I have here
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)41,INFJ,this is Christopher Columbus the four
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)42,INFJ,voyages it is edited and translated by
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)43,INFJ,JM Cowan excuse me
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)44,INFJ,and it is a well I'll read the little
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)45,INFJ,thing here being his own logbook letters
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)46,INFJ,and dispatches with connecting narrative
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)47,INFJ,drawn from the life of the admirer well
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)48,INFJ,excuse me the life of the admirer 'l by
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)49,INFJ,his son Hernando colon and other
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)50,INFJ,contemporary historians historians of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)51,INFJ,Columbus's time so it's literally just
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)52,INFJ,like an anthology that kind of runs
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)53,INFJ,through the the four voyages piecing
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)54,INFJ,together these different narratives
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)55,INFJ,because it's not like Columbus kept a
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)56,INFJ,you didn't well he did but we don't have
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)57,INFJ,all the journals and it's a little
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)58,INFJ,confusing I'll get into a little bit of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)59,INFJ,that as I get into the video but um
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)60,INFJ,Columbus obviously has been he's been
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)61,INFJ,made far posthumously the subject I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)62,INFJ,guess he's really kind of just been made
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)63,INFJ,into a symbol that can be you know hated
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)64,INFJ,on desecrated and I think people are
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)65,INFJ,really missing out because we have a
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)66,INFJ,very interesting multifaceted figure I I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)67,INFJ,just I don't like the it just seems very
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)68,INFJ,cheap and easy to me when people you
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)69,INFJ,know call them a con man or you know are
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)70,INFJ,like because there's always this
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)71,INFJ,assumption that well you learned in
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)72,INFJ,school like I did that Columbus was this
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)73,INFJ,remarkable saintly figure that descended
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)74,INFJ,from on high and well this is the real
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)75,INFJ,story man because I'm an edge lord and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)76,INFJ,it's like I never learned that in school
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)77,INFJ,so that's never resident I didn't learn
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)78,INFJ,really anything about Columbus in school
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)79,INFJ,that I can remember we just didn't even
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)80,INFJ,really talk about him so I never got
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)81,INFJ,that that kind of starry-eyed vision I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)82,INFJ,guess other people did and they sort of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)83,INFJ,have have projected their own vision of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)84,INFJ,the tyrannical father on to Columbus
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)85,INFJ,they've made Columbus their symbol I'm
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)86,INFJ,not going to get in a whole III haven't
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)87,INFJ,I haven't thought nearly enough
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)88,INFJ,about what other people have said about
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)89,INFJ,Columbus I'm not gonna get into that I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)90,INFJ,am just going to simply present to you
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)91,INFJ,what people in his own time and he
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)92,INFJ,himself wrote and you can decide what
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)93,INFJ,what what you want about him to to start
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)94,INFJ,right off I'm just gonna say that where
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)95,INFJ,I am leaning for his type is I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)96,INFJ,definitely think I am I am I'm not gonna
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)97,INFJ,say I'm certain but I am definitely
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)98,INFJ,highly inclined to think from from at
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)99,INFJ,least what I've read here and I'm not
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)100,INFJ,going through the whole book here I'm
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)101,INFJ,mainly going to focus on the first
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)102,INFJ,voyage because I have limited time at
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)103,INFJ,the moment but in the future I might go
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)104,INFJ,through the the other voyages shoot what
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)105,INFJ,was I talking about
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)106,INFJ,oh yes I believe that he is an S II and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)107,INFJ,I type specifically I think he is an S
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)108,INFJ,II dominant type I believe he has very a
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)109,INFJ,strong inferior and I that was a little
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)110,INFJ,bit out of control sometimes which can
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)111,INFJ,can be the case for a dominant se types
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)112,INFJ,and as for the middle access is judgment
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)113,INFJ,access I lean towards TEF I I think he
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)114,INFJ,was an es FP but possibly an est P but
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)115,INFJ,we'll get into why I lean more towards
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)116,INFJ,es FP I kind of have come to read him as
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)117,INFJ,a very boisterous energetic occasionally
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)118,INFJ,irresponsible but a very very driven
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)119,INFJ,person so actually let's first and start
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)120,INFJ,with them one of the things by the way
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)121,INFJ,about this is that JM Cullen is not
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)122,INFJ,really a fan of Columbus he is trying to
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)123,INFJ,be a very unbiased scholar but in his
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)124,INFJ,introduction he makes it pretty clear
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)125,INFJ,that he is you know perfectly happy
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)126,INFJ,being very critical of Columbus and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)127,INFJ,actually I think that some of the
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)128,INFJ,statements he makes in the introduction
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)129,INFJ,are not supported by the documents he
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)130,INFJ,includes in the book but I don't know I
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)131,INFJ,could be reading that wrong so let's go
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)132,INFJ,into a couple of things I don't know how
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)133,INFJ,much I'll quote from
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)134,INFJ,here I'll probably like so let me read
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)135,INFJ,this portion because this is a good
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)136,INFJ,place to start
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)137,INFJ,Columbus felt himself to be guided by a
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)138,INFJ,supernatural destiny to make the
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)139,INFJ,discoveries that he did and to add
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)140,INFJ,greatly to the dominions of the Catholic
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)141,INFJ,sovereigns as Christopher he was fated
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)142,INFJ,to carry his redeemer on his shoulders
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)143,INFJ,into distant lands it is this
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)144,INFJ,supernatural sense of mission to be read
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)145,INFJ,in all his writings that impelled him to
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)146,INFJ,the Indies and caused him to continue
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)147,INFJ,his search whether for the mainland of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)148,INFJ,Asia or the earthly paradise almost to
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)149,INFJ,the end of his life his gains and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)150,INFJ,Happiness were small and wealth not
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)151,INFJ,enormous but in patents of nobility
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)152,INFJ,which he valued highly very great excuse
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)153,INFJ,me yeah he did not ultimately make
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)154,INFJ,himself very wealthy for various reasons
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)155,INFJ,but um what I want to focus on obviously
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)156,INFJ,is that's a very and I kind of thing
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)157,INFJ,right is and technically n is e is and
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)158,INFJ,you you see it even just by the fact
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)159,INFJ,that he was willing to do this because
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)160,INFJ,literally it's it's made clear by some
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)161,INFJ,of the documents here that the reason
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)162,INFJ,that Columbus was so because he was like
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)163,INFJ,famous in his own time when he got back
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)164,INFJ,from the first voyage there were like
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)165,INFJ,parades and things like people were so
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)166,INFJ,because he brought back all this
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)167,INFJ,evidence that yeah I actually went to
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)168,INFJ,this place
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)169,INFJ,he brought Indians back with him not in
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)170,INFJ,Chains they it's it's complicated with
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)171,INFJ,the with being able to translate with
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)172,INFJ,them oh I'll get into that in a minute
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)173,INFJ,but there's like parades that he found
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)174,INFJ,they assumed yeah he found Asia later
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)175,INFJ,pretty quickly on people started to
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)176,INFJ,question him on that which he didn't
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)177,INFJ,like because he had this overriding
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)178,INFJ,sense of this is what I'm going to do
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)179,INFJ,this is my destiny this is the future
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)180,INFJ,for me there's like one point when you
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)181,INFJ,know what might be
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)182,INFJ,if I just run through very briefly a
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)183,INFJ,summary of kind of what happened with
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)184,INFJ,the first voyage so you get an idea of
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)185,INFJ,what the framework is here so you have
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)186,INFJ,Christopher Columbus unclear exactly
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)187,INFJ,where he came from there's some
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)188,INFJ,indication apparently that he had done
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)189,INFJ,some practical sailing work and merchant
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)190,INFJ,work before he had a son excuse me he
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)191,INFJ,was Italian Corsican that area in the
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)192,INFJ,Mediterranean and then for some reason
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)193,INFJ,it's it's never said or showed in this
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)194,INFJ,volume so I'd be curious if somebody has
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)195,INFJ,like earlier journals I would have
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)196,INFJ,thought that JM cone would include that
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)197,INFJ,but it's possible we just don't have it
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)198,INFJ,but at some point he got the idea and it
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)199,INFJ,really I think would have had to have
INFJ_I think Columbus was an Se type (1/2)200,INFJ,been almost like a kind of vision or
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed0,ENFJc,hey guys Jeffrey here with Auto alchemy
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed1,ENFJc,as you all may recall for a little while
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed2,ENFJc,there I was doing a series of videos
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed3,ENFJc,based on the objective personality
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed4,ENFJc,method of typing which was created by
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed5,ENFJc,Dave superpowers please check out the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed6,ENFJc,YouTube channel I think it's some pretty
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed7,ENFJc,interesting stuff so my goal with that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed8,ENFJc,project was to type these celebrities
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed9,ENFJc,before they were actually typed in the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed10,ENFJc,class that way I would have some sort of
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed11,ENFJc,documentation that I am a good student
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed12,ENFJc,and I was learning well and I was
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed13,ENFJc,beating Dave and Shan to the punch and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed14,ENFJc,so I stopped working on that project for
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed15,ENFJc,a couple of reasons probably the main
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed16,ENFJc,reason was that the whole clip within a
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed17,ENFJc,clip thing was a little too CPU
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed18,ENFJc,intensive for my computer anyhow and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed19,ENFJc,second of all while I felt reasonably
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed20,ENFJc,confident that I was an intp I wasn't
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed21,ENFJc,exactly sure if I would come out as an
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed22,ENFJc,intp under the parameters of that model
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed23,ENFJc,and so I kind of felt conflicted about
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed24,ENFJc,trying to play this particular
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed25,ENFJc,personality game when I wasn't even sure
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed26,ENFJc,that I could apply the rules to myself
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed27,ENFJc,any kind of neutral objective way so
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed28,ENFJc,it's like do you even understand what
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed29,ENFJc,you're doing maybe you should take a
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed30,ENFJc,step back maybe you should process more
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed31,ENFJc,consume a little more information and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed32,ENFJc,make sure you know what you're talking
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed33,ENFJc,about because it's really easy to see
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed34,ENFJc,other people in relation to who we are
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed35,ENFJc,and then and then use that to sort of
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed36,ENFJc,define our terms but if we're not even
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed37,ENFJc,sure that we're typing ourselves
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed38,ENFJc,correctly then that's a problem right
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed39,ENFJc,can I say it any better than that I
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed40,ENFJc,probably could say it better than that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed41,ENFJc,but you'd have to sign up for my
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed42,ENFJc,non-existent patreon for that kind of
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed43,ENFJc,insider knowledge so yeah I was pretty
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed44,ENFJc,curious about how I would come out in
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed45,ENFJc,the objective personality system so I
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed46,ENFJc,reached out to Dave and got the ball
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed47,ENFJc,rolling so I do feel somewhat obligated
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed48,ENFJc,to acknowledge the fact that there's
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed49,ENFJc,been a little bit of pushback in the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed50,ENFJc,typology community against the objective
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed51,ENFJc,personality system I'm not particularly
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed52,ENFJc,interested in getting into all that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed53,ENFJc,but I will say that all I'm going to say
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed54,ENFJc,is that if we're genuinely concerned
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed55,ENFJc,with what's true then I think that we
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed56,ENFJc,should embrace as many competing systems
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed57,ENFJc,of thought as possible and just let them
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed58,ENFJc,Duke it out you know anyway on to my
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed59,ENFJc,results I feel like I'm doing a 23andme
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed60,ENFJc,reveal which I would like to do at some
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed61,ENFJc,point but not now I wish I had an
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed62,ENFJc,envelope though so on screen somewhere
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed63,ENFJc,up here I've listed my top contenders
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed64,ENFJc,for what I thought my type was and this
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed65,ENFJc,is a list that I sent to Dave and Shan
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed66,ENFJc,and wingdings so that they could review
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed67,ENFJc,it later on after they'd actually tried
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed68,ENFJc,to type me and then see how presumably
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed69,ENFJc,awesome I was a self typing so from this
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed70,ENFJc,list you can see that I was reasonably
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed71,ENFJc,sure about a few things I was pretty
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed72,ENFJc,certain that I was an intp or maybe an
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed73,ENFJc,ENFP you know I felt very confident that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed74,ENFJc,I am an any user you know freaking
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed75,ENFJc,wingdings and I also felt pretty
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed76,ENFJc,confident that I exhibit a pretty
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed77,ENFJc,relative balance between self and tribe
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed78,ENFJc,thinking and feeling having dated a few
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed79,ENFJc,enfps in my life I didn't really think
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed80,ENFJc,that that resonated but I didn't want to
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed81,ENFJc,write it off completely especially
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed82,ENFJc,knowing that the objective personality
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed83,ENFJc,system has you know jumper types and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed84,ENFJc,there's a little more nuance to it
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed85,ENFJc,compared to some other ways of thinking
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed86,ENFJc,about this stuff so that's why the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed87,ENFJc,jumper types are a little bit higher on
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed88,ENFJc,my list I didn't think that I would be a
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed89,ENFJc,conventional ENFP if I were an ENFP at
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed90,ENFJc,all
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed91,ENFJc,so I also figured that I was double
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed92,ENFJc,feminine and if you don't understand
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed93,ENFJc,what that means in this context
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed94,ENFJc,basically the to sexual modalities are
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed95,ENFJc,determined by first your you're sensing
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed96,ENFJc,function and second your extroverted
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed97,ENFJc,decider so fe or te and basically a
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed98,ENFJc,feminine function is a little more fluid
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed99,ENFJc,and moveable whereas a masculine
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed100,ENFJc,function is solid and and resolute it
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed101,ENFJc,doesn't want to waver at all and it's
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed102,ENFJc,good to keep in mind that there's always
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed103,ENFJc,an equal yet opposite reaction going on
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed104,ENFJc,so if if I had extroverted feeling and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed105,ENFJc,were feminine than my
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed106,ENFJc,her two thinking would be masculine
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed107,ENFJc,meaning I would be very steady and firm
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed108,ENFJc,with my own you know reasoning and chain
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed109,ENFJc,of logic but I'd be willing to work with
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed110,ENFJc,the tribe and their emotions in order to
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed111,ENFJc,carry out these ti plans
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed112,ENFJc,I'm also absolutely sure that I was
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed113,ENFJc,blast last and in the objective
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed114,ENFJc,personality model blast is a function
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed115,ENFJc,combination which is concerned with
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed116,ENFJc,teaching and expelling information and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed117,ENFJc,getting started and I'm somebody who
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed118,ENFJc,really likes to spend my wheels I hate
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed119,ENFJc,getting started I I know that ent PS are
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed120,ENFJc,typically thought of as starter types
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed121,ENFJc,but for me that doesn't really resonate
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed122,ENFJc,I mean I do start things more than I
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed123,ENFJc,finish things but typically I'm more in
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed124,ENFJc,his face of consuming you know I I don't
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed125,ENFJc,really think I think of that as being
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed126,ENFJc,sort of outside of this teleological
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed127,ENFJc,kind of way of thinking and I also hate
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed128,ENFJc,teaching I used to be a TA and I thought
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed129,ENFJc,that I wanted to be a philosophy
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed130,ENFJc,professor or maybe an English professor
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed131,ENFJc,at the time but that was just so brutal
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed132,ENFJc,I never feel like I've internalized the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed133,ENFJc,information enough to share it I never
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed134,ENFJc,feel confident that I have a good grasp
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed135,ENFJc,on what I'm understanding the the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed136,ENFJc,details are so slippery in my hands and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed137,ENFJc,I just don't want to subject anybody to
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed138,ENFJc,my poor teaching which is you know one
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed139,ENFJc,of the big reasons that I wanted to join
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed140,ENFJc,YouTube I knew that this could be a nice
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed141,ENFJc,arena for me to practice blasting even
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed142,ENFJc,though I didn't I didn't know it as that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed143,ENFJc,at the time so yeah that's the stuff
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed144,ENFJc,that I felt pretty confident about
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed145,ENFJc,that's my list it gave them six
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed146,ENFJc,different options to kind of hedge my
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed147,ENFJc,bets surely I got it right somewhere in
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed148,ENFJc,there right no no just being dramatic
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed149,ENFJc,because I was pretty close to be honest
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed150,ENFJc,so here we go and look at this student
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed151,ENFJc,he's just so frickin handsome I want to
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed152,ENFJc,pinch his cheeks so as you can see I
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed153,ENFJc,kind of killed it the only thing that I
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed154,ENFJc,had wrong was that I thought that I was
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed155,ENFJc,sleep over blast how did I mess that up
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed156,ENFJc,am I not sleepy all of the time am i not
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed157,ENFJc,exhausted and yeah that's kind of the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed158,ENFJc,point the idea is that if you're always
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed159,ENFJc,moving
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed160,ENFJc,consuming something always playing
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed161,ENFJc,always blasting then inevitably if
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed162,ENFJc,you're not taking care of that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed163,ENFJc,particular animal if you're not taking
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed164,ENFJc,care of that particular function set
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed165,ENFJc,then the world is going to force your
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed166,ENFJc,hand in the same way that if you over
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed167,ENFJc,gather information you might suddenly
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed168,ENFJc,look around your room and notice that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed169,ENFJc,everything is in sensory disarray and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed170,ENFJc,you can't find you like you might be
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed171,ENFJc,trying to work on some sort of intuitive
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed172,ENFJc,project but you can't find the book that
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed173,ENFJc,you were looking for and it's like I
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed174,ENFJc,have to clean I don't want to clean but
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed175,ENFJc,I have to clean I have to get I have to
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed176,ENFJc,get my stuff in order so the world will
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed177,ENFJc,force your hand if you're not careful
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed178,ENFJc,and that's why I'm so exhausted all the
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed179,ENFJc,time I do not in any way carve out a
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed180,ENFJc,space to be reflective and and process
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed181,ENFJc,information and just really withdraw
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed182,ENFJc,within myself and that's a problem so
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed183,ENFJc,even though I claim to dislike blasting
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed184,ENFJc,I think it's really telling that I would
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed185,ENFJc,rather make a youtube video than sit and
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed186,ENFJc,process all by my lonesome and sleep
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed187,ENFJc,energy was honestly what that dopamine
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed188,ENFJc,fast video was all about if you really
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed189,ENFJc,get down to it I I wasn't allowed to
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed190,ENFJc,distract myself you know consumed being
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed191,ENFJc,my primary mode of existence I wasn't
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed192,ENFJc,allowed to do any of that and wasn't
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed193,ENFJc,really allowed to play there was no
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed194,ENFJc,tribal interaction so honestly I could
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed195,ENFJc,probably benefit from doing one of those
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed196,ENFJc,baths like every other week or something
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed197,ENFJc,and even if the dopamine fast
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed198,ENFJc,I had to convert it into a video idea I
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed199,ENFJc,had to make it into a product which is
ENFJc_My Objective Personality Type Revealed200,ENFJc,kind of ironic because the whole thing
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED0,INFJ,hi I'm Bill Gates and these are moments
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED1,INFJ,from my life Paul Allen who's the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED2,INFJ,co-founder of Microsoft and I are at
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED3,INFJ,Lakeside High School and that's a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED4,INFJ,teletype terminal that connects over a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED5,INFJ,phone line to a GE Time short computer
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED6,INFJ,where you can write basic programs I was
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED7,INFJ,13 when that teletype showed up and I
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED8,INFJ,had done super well in a math exam you
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED9,INFJ,know best in the state
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED10,INFJ,so Paul who was 2 years ahead of me when
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED11,INFJ,the computers kind of complicated he
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED12,INFJ,kind of challenged me to say hey you
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED13,INFJ,know math can you figure this out and so
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED14,INFJ,he and I became good friends
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED15,INFJ,despite that age difference and you know
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED16,INFJ,Paul had read a lot of science fiction
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED17,INFJ,and knew a lot of things I didn't so our
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED18,INFJ,friendship and partnership started up
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED19,INFJ,from that time forward and in this
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED20,INFJ,computer room the teachers had come in
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED21,INFJ,and tried to figure it out but they
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED22,INFJ,ended up wasting a lot of money and so
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED23,INFJ,we kind of took over the the computer
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED24,INFJ,room and taught the other kids how to
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED25,INFJ,program we're writing huge complex
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED26,INFJ,programs and basic trying to solve hard
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED27,INFJ,problems a lot of kids were interested
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED28,INFJ,at first but there were a small group
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED29,INFJ,that stayed just in day and night using
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED30,INFJ,the thing it's still there
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED31,INFJ,my daughter who goes to that school
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED32,INFJ,calls it the shrine so this is kind of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED33,INFJ,an array of different computers there
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED34,INFJ,were a lot of personal computers way
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED35,INFJ,before the IBM PC that comes out in 1981
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED36,INFJ,Microsoft had its software on all of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED37,INFJ,them the Apple - the Commodore pad the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED38,INFJ,Radio Shack trs-80 about a dozen
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED39,INFJ,machines that were done in Japan you
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED40,INFJ,know we worked on a ton of come machines
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED41,INFJ,we were spreading the idea that these
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED42,INFJ,microprocessor based machines would be
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED43,INFJ,revolutionary the one right here was the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED44,INFJ,first portable computer that's a eight
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED45,INFJ,line LCD with 32 characters across
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED46,INFJ,that's called the model 100 that's the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED47,INFJ,last piece of software that I was the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED48,INFJ,primary engineer and then I you know
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED49,INFJ,sort of more managed people well I still
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED50,INFJ,coded but this is the project where I'm
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED51,INFJ,totally in charge now
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED52,INFJ,so figuring out how to fit into a 32k
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED53,INFJ,byte wrong a floating-point basic and a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED54,INFJ,text editor or an a director manager so
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED55,INFJ,that was a super fun very difficult
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED56,INFJ,project so I wrote code you know even to
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED57,INFJ,this day I do some architecture things
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED58,INFJ,on the the various products but yeah I
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED59,INFJ,missed the elegance of you know writing
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED60,INFJ,super tight code almost nobody does that
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED61,INFJ,now cuz memory is so big people can be a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED62,INFJ,bit more sloppy than you could be back
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED63,INFJ,then the microprocessor
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED64,INFJ,had been coming along and Paul in 1971
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED65,INFJ,showed me the four thousand four which
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED66,INFJ,is the first Intel product and we talked
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED67,INFJ,about Moore's law I'd written basic for
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED68,INFJ,a lot of many computers that were still
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED69,INFJ,quite expensive and when he showed me
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED70,INFJ,the 8080 I said no it's not good enough
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED71,INFJ,but the 8080 that's 1973 that was good
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED72,INFJ,enough for me to do a basic interpreter
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED73,INFJ,so you know that became our first
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED74,INFJ,product and that was you know that was
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED75,INFJ,the revolution that was the thing that
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED76,INFJ,assured in personal computing the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED77,INFJ,creation of Microsoft and being part of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED78,INFJ,the personal computer industry and you
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED79,INFJ,know then the internet and all that
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED80,INFJ,great things that come out of that and I
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED81,INFJ,feel super super lucky to have had a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED82,INFJ,central involvement along with thousands
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED83,INFJ,of others in in those days well Windows
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED84,INFJ,95 was a big milestone for the company
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED85,INFJ,this series of events was a immensely
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED86,INFJ,fun for everybody who's involved because
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED87,INFJ,we had been working day and night these
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED88,INFJ,were pretty maniacal days in terms of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED89,INFJ,work was everything even you know I
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED90,INFJ,didn't believe in weekends or vacations
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED91,INFJ,the team pretty broadly had worked super
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED92,INFJ,super hard the marketing people had
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED93,INFJ,figured out how to take this phenomena
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED94,INFJ,and you know get create a lot of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED95,INFJ,excitement around it you know we all
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED96,INFJ,over the world we had things being lit
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED97,INFJ,up in the windows colors we had big
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED98,INFJ,events all over the world there have
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED99,INFJ,been a lot of anticipation because the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED100,INFJ,beta test was literally hundreds of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED101,INFJ,thousands of copies of this thing and
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED102,INFJ,all the developers who had written
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED103,INFJ,applications for it were waiting because
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED104,INFJ,the memory capacity you got in this
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED105,INFJ,generation machines was so much better
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED106,INFJ,than what came before this was the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED107,INFJ,ushering in of the graphics interface
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED108,INFJ,moving from character mode which all the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED109,INFJ,Dass worked before this had been to this
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED110,INFJ,graphics mode and Windows 95 on the PC
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED111,INFJ,and then the Mac OS on the Mac were
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED112,INFJ,bringing graphics interface into the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED113,INFJ,mainstream it had been sort of invented
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED114,INFJ,at Xerox PARC with some very expensive
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED115,INFJ,low volume type machines but Windows 95
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED116,INFJ,you know we brought office across and
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED117,INFJ,this product was phenomenally successful
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED118,INFJ,caught on in a big wage windows itself
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED119,INFJ,I had bet the company on all the way
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED120,INFJ,back in 1983 and so there's 12 years of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED121,INFJ,getting the windows concept to be faster
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED122,INFJ,and the processors are getting better
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED123,INFJ,and here clearly had arrived and there
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED124,INFJ,was no doubt that versus anything else
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED125,INFJ,out there this was the mainstream of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED126,INFJ,computing and all the developers were
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED127,INFJ,there to to take full advantage of it
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED128,INFJ,yes so this is a Melinda who I was not
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED129,INFJ,yet married to at the time although we
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED130,INFJ,were engaged we're out on the the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED131,INFJ,Serengeti for our first trip to Africa
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED132,INFJ,and we're kind of looking around we have
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED133,INFJ,took a bunch of friends with us it was
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED134,INFJ,the first long vacation I'd ever taken
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED135,INFJ,it was a two-week vacation which seemed
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED136,INFJ,quite extreme to me but it was you know
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED137,INFJ,great fun and very eye-opening it's
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED138,INFJ,important because it's you know the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED139,INFJ,start of our marriage but also some of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED140,INFJ,the insights that led to the foundation
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED141,INFJ,being focused on health of the poorest
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED142,INFJ,particularly in Africa came from the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED143,INFJ,curiosity about the people and you know
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED144,INFJ,we're living in very tough conditions
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED145,INFJ,and so subsequent to this she and I did
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED146,INFJ,a lot of reading with this idea that
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED147,INFJ,okay someday the Microsoft wealth was
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED148,INFJ,gonna go back to the public and what how
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED149,INFJ,you know the lens towards innovation and
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED150,INFJ,I'm really helping those most in need
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED151,INFJ,how could we do that well in you know in
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED152,INFJ,Microsoft my early partner was Paul
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED153,INFJ,Allen and then Steve Ballmer was my
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED154,INFJ,partner now Melinda's you know even a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED155,INFJ,totally equal partner and all the
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED156,INFJ,foundation work we're doing so she she
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED157,INFJ,and I run it together it was so
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED158,INFJ,fascinating I mean the relationships we
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED159,INFJ,were building learning all this new
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED160,INFJ,stuff to have somebody to brainstorm
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED161,INFJ,with about it you know made it a lot
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED162,INFJ,more fun you know things like writing
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED163,INFJ,letters together giving speeches
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED164,INFJ,together we had to learn how to bring
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED165,INFJ,out the best of the both of us and in
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED166,INFJ,doing those things but yeah it was
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED167,INFJ,always you know clear we wanted to do it
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED168,INFJ,together
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED169,INFJ,[Music]
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED170,INFJ,yeah we're backstage at the Microsoft
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED171,INFJ,CEO conference and Warren's telling me a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED172,INFJ,story about a business that he had
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED173,INFJ,invested in you know was a guy call him
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED174,INFJ,on the phone you know trying to tell him
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED175,INFJ,he had an investment that Warren should
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED176,INFJ,make and Warren was explaining why it
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED177,INFJ,was pretty clearly not something that he
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED178,INFJ,was gonna waste money on he's such a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED179,INFJ,been such a great friend and you know so
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED180,INFJ,clever and I've learned so much from him
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED181,INFJ,you know he's got an amazing sense of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED182,INFJ,humor well I was very lucky that we were
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED183,INFJ,introduced and it was 1991 where I was
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED184,INFJ,quite reluctant to take any time away
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED185,INFJ,from work within a few minutes of
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED186,INFJ,meeting him he was asking questions
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED187,INFJ,about why could Microsoft compete with
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED188,INFJ,IBM and what were the dynamics and our
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED189,INFJ,business there were really amazingly
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED190,INFJ,good questions that nobody really had
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED191,INFJ,asked before and then I could ask him
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED192,INFJ,about his broader view of business and
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED193,INFJ,so we you know we became great friends
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED194,INFJ,right from that that first meeting well
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED195,INFJ,a hobby of mine so I was playing tennis
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED196,INFJ,and so it was it you know real privilege
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED197,INFJ,to do a fundraising event where I was a
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED198,INFJ,doubles partner with Roger Federer well
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED199,INFJ,you know he's gonna take care of it you
INFJ_Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED200,INFJ,practice saying yours as loud as you can
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP0,ESTPc,hi and welcome back to entp life in
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP1,ESTPc,today's video i'm here to talk to you
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP2,ESTPc,about what does emt-p life mean anyway a
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP3,ESTPc,lot of you out there think that entp
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP4,ESTPc,life stands for the entrepreneurs life
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP5,ESTPc,and even though that's what it may seem
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP6,ESTPc,like it's really a nod to my
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP7,ESTPc,myers-briggs personality type and I

ESTPc_Life As An ENTP75,ESTPc,interest in cooking

ESTPc_Life As An ENTP81,ESTPc,hip hop music to be sure CEO of a home
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP82,ESTPc,health care agency x-ray tech cascade
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP83,ESTPc,technologist auto body specialist
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP84,ESTPc,fashion photographer product
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP85,ESTPc,photographer I founded a fashion
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP86,ESTPc,technology company called style scam if
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP87,ESTPc,you guys even google Salkin it was a
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP88,ESTPc,fashion social network that allowed
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP89,ESTPc,people to post images and categorize
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP90,ESTPc,them by brand category category and
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP91,ESTPc,color and youtube personality just add
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP92,ESTPc,it to the list okay and what happens
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP93,ESTPc,with me as as a person is that I take
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP94,ESTPc,interest in a lot of different things
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP95,ESTPc,and I'm able to also in my mind connect
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP96,ESTPc,all these different things and make them
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP97,ESTPc,almost related I could almost create an
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP98,ESTPc,analogy for it for anything and so many
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP99,ESTPc,things function on the same principles
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP100,ESTPc,or the same rule so I'm able to learn
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP101,ESTPc,things really quickly and I'm able to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP102,ESTPc,really hyper focus one problem with the
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP103,ESTPc,emts personality type is that since
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP104,ESTPc,we're able to get a track that's a lot
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP105,ESTPc,of this danger like that the guy who
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP106,ESTPc,chases the shiny thing all the time
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP107,ESTPc,we may start something that we are
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP108,ESTPc,passionate about everybody knows it and
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP109,ESTPc,then one morning wake up and say I don't
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP110,ESTPc,feel like doing that
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP111,ESTPc,and move on to the next thing we're
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP112,ESTPc,really good at making money and often
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP113,ESTPc,times set to not really know how to keep
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP114,ESTPc,it and I could see where that's true is
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP115,ESTPc,because when we're passionate about
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP116,ESTPc,whatever it is we go in we're able to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP117,ESTPc,say okay I have this passion project I
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP118,ESTPc,also know how to monetize it etc but
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP119,ESTPc,since we're so horrible at maintenance
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP120,ESTPc,type work and repetitive work that once
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP121,ESTPc,it gets to be routine and mundane we
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP122,ESTPc,would rather kill ourselves or lose all
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP123,ESTPc,of our money everything that we invested
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP124,ESTPc,just to avoid doing the repetitive work
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP125,ESTPc,so how has that affected me and my
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP126,ESTPc,person that and in my personal life or
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP127,ESTPc,in my business life well what I know is
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP128,ESTPc,that my attention span is about six
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP129,ESTPc,months okay
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP130,ESTPc,so if I'm going to be starting a new
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP131,ESTPc,business or a new project or whatever
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP132,ESTPc,the case may be I know that it needs to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP133,ESTPc,get to the point of stability where I'm
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP134,ESTPc,able to hire people to to continue to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP135,ESTPc,run it or I don't do it right if it does
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP136,ESTPc,if that can't happen in six months I
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP137,ESTPc,don't even get myself involved because I
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP138,ESTPc,know that I'm not the type to stay with
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP139,ESTPc,the same work for two three four years
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP140,ESTPc,building organically you know whatever I
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP141,ESTPc,get myself into has to be able to scale
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP142,ESTPc,to a point that it's it's able to run
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP143,ESTPc,itself within six months or I'm able to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP144,ESTPc,hire employees at that six-month mark
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP145,ESTPc,and be cashflow positive and continue to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP146,ESTPc,grow that out if it if it doesn't have
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP147,ESTPc,that potential I absolutely know that
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP148,ESTPc,it's gonna end up crashing and failing
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP149,ESTPc,because I'm not gonna be that interested
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP150,ESTPc,beyond that and what happens is after
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP151,ESTPc,I've been away from something long
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP152,ESTPc,enough it starts to get my interest
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP153,ESTPc,again so I come back around and say okay
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP154,ESTPc,let me check in on this business and see
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP155,ESTPc,how it's doing
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP156,ESTPc,and what I do now that that's really
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP157,ESTPc,good for me is that the businesses that
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP158,ESTPc,I do get myself involved in I'm looking
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP159,ESTPc,at setting up the structure in a way
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP160,ESTPc,that at that six-month mark I'm able to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP161,ESTPc,kind of move on to something else but I
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP162,ESTPc,do come back around and set a plan for
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP163,ESTPc,the employees who are in place who are
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP164,ESTPc,working work for pushing the idea
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP165,ESTPc,further who could even work better than
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP166,ESTPc,me they may not be as innovative
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP167,ESTPc,they may not be as clever they may not
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP168,ESTPc,be able to find the hacks in that
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP169,ESTPc,industry but they're able to execute on
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP170,ESTPc,the original plan and what you're
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP171,ESTPc,working and then when I have the new
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP172,ESTPc,innovative idea and the new thing that I
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP173,ESTPc,want to layer on top of that existing
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP174,ESTPc,business I come back around talk to my
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP175,ESTPc,management team get them motivated again
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP176,ESTPc,and do it all over again and by doing
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP177,ESTPc,things that way I'm able to move from
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP178,ESTPc,one industry to the next to the next and
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP179,ESTPc,continue to innovate and continue to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP180,ESTPc,grow without imploding on myself
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP181,ESTPc,other intps are known to kind of have
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP182,ESTPc,the same patterns and and almost become
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP183,ESTPc,the guy that has always has that great
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP184,ESTPc,idea that like that crazy uncle who's
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP185,ESTPc,always inventing things but never really
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP186,ESTPc,kind of gets past that because they
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP187,ESTPc,never realized that hey this is what's
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP188,ESTPc,going on with me and never structured or
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP189,ESTPc,set themselves up to kind of protect
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP190,ESTPc,themselves in those pitfalls so if
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP191,ESTPc,you're an EMC C personality type and
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP192,ESTPc,you've been struggling with consistency
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP193,ESTPc,guess what that's totally normal for
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP194,ESTPc,your personality mate what you need to
ESTPc_Life As An ENTP195,ESTPc,do is pair yourself up with the ESF days

ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP0,ISFP,hey world is Sheela and first of all I'm
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP1,ISFP,so excited I want to thank you guys for
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP2,ISFP,subscribing to my channel and all your
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP3,ISFP,likes and I have hit 100 subscribers
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP4,ISFP,it's funny because I started this
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP5,ISFP,channel just to kind of work on
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP6,ISFP,expressing myself and being you know
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP7,ISFP,secure in just getting myself out there
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP8,ISFP,and not being afraid of the tribe and
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP9,ISFP,getting attacked by the tribe because oh
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP10,ISFP,I think is f Peas it is really hard to
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP11,ISFP,put ourselves out there for critique for
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP12,ISFP,any type of backlash I mean I I'm just
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP13,ISFP,always terrified of yeah being attacked
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP14,ISFP,um I don't know other ISPs do you guys
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP15,ISFP,experienced that just that fear but just
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP16,ISFP,putting ourselves out there and not
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP17,ISFP,knowing what's gonna happen it's
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP18,ISFP,probably that that and I being a little
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP19,ISFP,lower of woo not being able to predict
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP20,ISFP,the future and what's the outcome and so
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP21,ISFP,maybe that's a little bit of that so
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP22,ISFP,today's topic is about reasons and why
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP23,ISFP,for me it is almost impossible to want
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP24,ISFP,to give reasons and I think the thinking
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP25,ISFP,part in being an ISP is lower obviously
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP26,ISFP,our te is fourth and we work in the
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP27,ISFP,realm of feelings and just being secure
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP28,ISFP,in how we feel about things in general
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP29,ISFP,our values our likes and don't likes and
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP30,ISFP,what we want to do it just it's all kind
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP31,ISFP,of just we go into ourselves
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP32,ISFP,the time and if something comes up I'm
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP33,ISFP,like huh and I go in I check with myself
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP34,ISFP,is this right is this morally what I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP35,ISFP,want to be is this what I want to do is
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP36,ISFP,this does it line up with who I am at my
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP37,ISFP,being so when the outside world is
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP38,ISFP,asking us for the reasons I'm like I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP39,ISFP,don't know because it's just the way I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP40,ISFP,am it's just the way I feel it's the way
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP41,ISFP,I think it's the way I I am
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP42,ISFP,I don't so an example of that is
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP43,ISFP,somebody asked me well what's your
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP44,ISFP,favorite color and like oh it's pink why
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP45,ISFP,do you like pink and I had to think
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP46,ISFP,about it because my first response is
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP47,ISFP,always well just because or I don't know
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP48,ISFP,and so I have to really kind of take the
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP49,ISFP,time like okay why do I like pink and I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP50,ISFP,said well I think pink is pretty and
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP51,ISFP,they're like but why do you think you
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP52,ISFP,know why why do you think pink is pretty
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP53,ISFP,why do you like it and I'm like well
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP54,ISFP,pink is pretty because I like it and
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP55,ISFP,it's just this like circle of I can't
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP56,ISFP,give like a logical argument of why I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP57,ISFP,like it I am always coming from a
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP58,ISFP,feeling base of why I like something and
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP59,ISFP,I have a hard time putting the words to
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP60,ISFP,it like so if somebody says okay what
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP61,ISFP,hobby do you like or what's your
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP62,ISFP,favorite hobby or something and I'm like
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP63,ISFP,well I like sewing and I'll say well why
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP64,ISFP,do you like sewing and I can kind of
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP65,ISFP,give it a little more reasons I think
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP66,ISFP,the reasons are there my reasons like
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP67,ISFP,well I like sewing because I love to be
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP68,ISFP,creative I love to
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP69,ISFP,work with my hands and I love creating
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP70,ISFP,something for beauty so those are kind
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP71,ISFP,of reasons why I like sewing and to me I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP72,ISFP,think those are good reasons are they
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP73,ISFP,are they logically sound I don't know
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP74,ISFP,are they more feeling basis sound I have
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP75,ISFP,a hard time parsing out the difference
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP76,ISFP,between my Fi and my te I mean because
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP77,ISFP,they do work together but my Fi is just
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP78,ISFP,like this a huge part of me and then my
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP79,ISFP,T's like this little baby part and like
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP80,ISFP,I don't know I just like it because
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP81,ISFP,don't ask me don't give me it don't make
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP82,ISFP,me give reasons for why I want to do
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP83,ISFP,something why I did something why
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP84,ISFP,anything yeah and I don't like to argue
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP85,ISFP,in general and I think a lot of isfps
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP86,ISFP,are Enneagram 9 I think a lot the other
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP87,ISFP,rows like a four fours and 9s tend to be
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP88,ISFP,the highest I think 9 being the highest
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP89,ISFP,so we don't like to argue one probably
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP90,ISFP,because we are not good at logically
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP91,ISFP,block banging the reasons in the
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP92,ISFP,external world for an argument I just
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP93,ISFP,find myself shutting down I'm just like
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP94,ISFP,if somebody comes at me hardcore with an
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP95,ISFP,argument and it's something I'm not you
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP96,ISFP,know very passionate about or something
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP97,ISFP,I really believe I'm like mmm that's I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP98,ISFP,just back off I'm like okay and and it's
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP99,ISFP,all fine and dandy I don't want to join
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP100,ISFP,that argument I don't want to think
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP101,ISFP,about it I just want to feel um now if
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP102,ISFP,somebody's coming at me with a belief of
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP103,ISFP,mine like so say they're arguing about
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP104,ISFP,my identity and this comes off um comes
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP105,ISFP,up you know often on just when you put
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP106,ISFP,yourself out there in the MBTI
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP107,ISFP,people are always gonna have their
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP108,ISFP,opinions about your type and I know 100%
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP109,ISFP,I'm isfp there are some people out there
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP110,ISFP,that still want to argue that and when
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP111,ISFP,it comes up I want to just fight like
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP112,ISFP,tooth and nail and I want to be seen I
ISFP_Reasons are hard for an ISFP113,ISFP,want to be heard I want them to just

INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language16,INFJc,some of their giveaway quirks and some
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language17,INFJc,of their core interests and values what

INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language19,INFJc,language habits that are related to
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language20,INFJc,their core values and their core
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language21,INFJc,interests you can read it in their face

INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language23,INFJc,and their gestures and how they interact
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language24,INFJc,and how they use and engage in and show
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language25,INFJc,their emotions outwardly so I don't
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language26,INFJc,believe anybody can read a person's type
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language27,INFJc,based on facial features how the shape
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language28,INFJc,of the eyes are or the size of the nose
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language29,INFJc,or anything like that i don't believe i
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language30,INFJc,believe that pseudoscience but i do
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language31,INFJc,believe that we have distinct ways

INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language35,INFJc,facial expressions and our body language
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language36,INFJc,mirror is that one core quirk I found
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language37,INFJc,was that extroverts tend to rather than
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language38,INFJc,pull information from inside out they
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language39,INFJc,tend to gather information from the
INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language40,INFJc,world around them that's core sign you

INFJc_How To Spot An ENTP: Body Language56,INFJc,see that also in their their gestures

ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP23,ENFJ,looking at life I don't need to tell you
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP24,ENFJ,that but essentially what I have what
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP25,ENFJ,I'm wanting to get to in this series
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP26,ENFJ,that I find really fascinating is how

ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP28,ENFJ,how life is based on just sort of
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP29,ENFJ,shifting your perspective so I'm gonna

ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP31,ENFJ,guys hate long disclaimers the number
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP32,ENFJ,one thing that I have realized about
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP33,ENFJ,life through observing and interacting
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP34,ENFJ,with Ian TPS is you don't know unless
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP35,ENFJ,you also know what you don't know and he
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP36,ENFJ,pees in my experience are really afraid
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP37,ENFJ,of the unknown unknowns out there and a
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP38,ENFJ,lot of them use that term a lot will
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP39,ENFJ,they say well there's the known owns and
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP40,ENFJ,then
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP41,ENFJ,the known unknowns but then there's also
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP42,ENFJ,the unknown unknowns and so an intp
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP43,ENFJ,isn't really confident in their
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP44,ENFJ,perspective unless they have converted
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP45,ENFJ,as many of those unknown unknowns into
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP46,ENFJ,at least known unknowns
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP47,ENFJ,hopefully known knowns an teepees never
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP48,ENFJ,stop questioning their perspective they
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP49,ENFJ,don't whenever they land on a
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP50,ENFJ,perspective that doesn't mean that they
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP51,ENFJ,have stopped questioning because an
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP52,ENFJ,teepees know how many unknown unknowns
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP53,ENFJ,there are and so they're gonna continue
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP54,ENFJ,to ask questions and continue to put
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP55,ENFJ,their own perspective and the
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP56,ENFJ,perspective of others underneath a
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP57,ENFJ,microscope to sort of make sure that
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP58,ENFJ,they aren't leaving out any you know
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP59,ENFJ,unknown unknowns that could just whack
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP60,ENFJ,them in the face unexpectedly so I
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP61,ENFJ,really admire this in an intp because
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP62,ENFJ,even whenever they are really stubborn
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP63,ENFJ,and really strong in their opinion and
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP64,ENFJ,they might be arguing with you it you
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP65,ENFJ,might if those of you who aren't en TPS
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP66,ENFJ,might be taken aback by that because you
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP67,ENFJ,might view that as really condescending
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP68,ENFJ,or arrogant or nitpicky or all these
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP69,ENFJ,other things you have to remember that
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP70,ENFJ,you know the auntie peas they're just
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP71,ENFJ,wanting to explore that idea with you
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP72,ENFJ,and they're inviting you to explore it
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP73,ENFJ,together and they're wanting information
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP74,ENFJ,from you and I have noticed correct me
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP75,ENFJ,if I'm wrong that emt peas can get a
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP76,ENFJ,little angry with people who won't
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP77,ENFJ,really share how their beliefs were
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP78,ENFJ,formed because not because they're
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP79,ENFJ,necessarily critiquing you or your idea
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP80,ENFJ,but they want to know how the idea was
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP81,ENFJ,formed so that they can sort of check
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP82,ENFJ,off their boxes of what what have I
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP83,ENFJ,taken into consideration into this
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP84,ENFJ,belief so even though auntie
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP85,ENFJ,can be really good arguers they also
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP86,ENFJ,have an extreme open mind and so I have
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP87,ENFJ,wanted to apply this perspective to my
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP88,ENFJ,life as well because as an ENFJ I tend
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP89,ENFJ,to stick to my beliefs pretty firmly
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP90,ENFJ,because it takes me a really long time
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP91,ENFJ,to get there and once I'm there I kind
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP92,ENFJ,of stay there and that's kind of what
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP93,ENFJ,it's like to have inferior introverted
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP94,ENFJ,thinking because I do value interpretive
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP95,ENFJ,thinking like you do but for me I don't
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP96,ENFJ,feel as comfortable talking about things
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP97,ENFJ,I don't necessarily know for sure and so
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP98,ENFJ,I will just sort of observe and my
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP99,ENFJ,interpretive thinking will be more
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP100,ENFJ,silent and on the backburner
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP101,ENFJ,whereas ntps engage in their
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP102,ENFJ,interpretive thinking when talking to
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP103,ENFJ,people and their ideas are being
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP104,ENFJ,questioned in real time where for me
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP105,ENFJ,honestly my ideas I question them alone
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP106,ENFJ,on my own time or like without really
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP107,ENFJ,discussing them with people which what
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP108,ENFJ,I've really learned through an teepees
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP109,ENFJ,is that that's not always the best way
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP110,ENFJ,to what's the word I'm thinking of
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP111,ENFJ,troubleshoot troubleshoot that's not
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP112,ENFJ,really the best way to troubleshoot my
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP113,ENFJ,ideas whenever I keep my mouth shut
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP114,ENFJ,about what I believe and what I think
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP115,ENFJ,I'm not really doing any troubleshooting
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP116,ENFJ,of whether or not what I'm saying is
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP117,ENFJ,true or whether or not I've considered
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP118,ENFJ,all of the potential you know potential
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP119,ENFJ,factors that could be at play for me I
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP120,ENFJ,really just take my own sweet time
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP121,ENFJ,coming to a conclusion through observing
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP122,ENFJ,and sort of talking to people and
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP123,ENFJ,nodding my head at what they're saying
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP124,ENFJ,and then I will sort of go out there and
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP125,ENFJ,be like alright guys this is what I have
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP126,ENFJ,decided and yeah and it's normally the
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP127,ENFJ,auntie peas that question me and
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP128,ENFJ,honestly make me sometimes very insecure
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP129,ENFJ,in my own idea because I'm not used to
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP130,ENFJ,voicing it and I can make me
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP131,ENFJ,sometimes on edge but at the end of the
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP132,ENFJ,day I really do appreciate that about
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP133,ENFJ,the NTP because they're really just
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP134,ENFJ,trying to make sure that you've
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP135,ENFJ,considered every angle because I used to
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP136,ENFJ,sort of think you know if I know
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP137,ENFJ,something in my gut that I know it but I
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP138,ENFJ,think that any thinks about what things
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP139,ENFJ,are not they don't just think about what
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP140,ENFJ,things are and for me I use extroverted
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP141,ENFJ,sensing which is way more focus on what
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP142,ENFJ,is an NES focus on also what not is or
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP143,ENFJ,what could be or what it used to be or
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP144,ENFJ,other ways of being that's why I sort of
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP145,ENFJ,think of NPs as really viewing life as
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP146,ENFJ,like all these different dimensions and
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP147,ENFJ,stuff like that and peas I know
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP148,ENFJ,especially NTP seem to be really
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP149,ENFJ,interested in concepts like time travel
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP150,ENFJ,and most of dimensions and stuff like
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP151,ENFJ,that because there's always this like
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP152,ENFJ,what if what could be and I don't
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP153,ENFJ,normally look at my opinions through
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP154,ENFJ,that lens I go with what I feel is right
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP155,ENFJ,and so the perspective of an INTP has
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP156,ENFJ,taught me to think up through a little
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP157,ENFJ,bit more and scrutinize myself more and
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP158,ENFJ,I think also I've learned to share my
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP159,ENFJ,opinions even before their 100%
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP160,ENFJ,bulletproof because I think aunty peas
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP161,ENFJ,know that there's always going to be a
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP162,ENFJ,little bit of unknown unknown out there
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP163,ENFJ,and you have to sort of be prepared for
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP164,ENFJ,it where you can say your opinion
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP165,ENFJ,strongly but you also always have to be
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP166,ENFJ,open to being wrong because for me
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP167,ENFJ,sometimes they'd be very black-and-white
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP168,ENFJ,of like if I don't know it's true I'm
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP169,ENFJ,not gonna say anything
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP170,ENFJ,but then once I said something I have
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP171,ENFJ,looked at every angle which a lot of
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP172,ENFJ,times it's not really every angle it's
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP173,ENFJ,just in my own head or with my own
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP174,ENFJ,people
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP175,ENFJ,ah but ent peas when they open their
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP176,ENFJ,mouth to share their opinion they're
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP177,ENFJ,always aware of the unknown unknown out
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP178,ENFJ,there and they're always aware that
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP179,ENFJ,there could be evidence or a perspective
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP180,ENFJ,or something that completely that can
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP181,ENFJ,completely knock off what they have been
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP182,ENFJ,thinking but the thing I really admire
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP183,ENFJ,though about ent Peas is that they
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP184,ENFJ,aren't going to just change their mind
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP185,ENFJ,that easily
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP186,ENFJ,they're gonna always just integrate what
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP187,ENFJ,they've learned with their perspective
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP188,ENFJ,that they've already built and so by
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP189,ENFJ,that sense they're always growing and so
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP190,ENFJ,and they're always seeking learning
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP191,ENFJ,opportunities and they also in my
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP192,ENFJ,experience tend to be very well-rounded
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP193,ENFJ,individuals they don't just stick to one
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP194,ENFJ,thing that they're learning about and so
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP195,ENFJ,I really admire the ante peas that have
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP196,ENFJ,figured out how to have a bunch of
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP197,ENFJ,different interests and then combine it
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP198,ENFJ,with something new and then let's say
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP199,ENFJ,you're interested in like something like
ENFJ_What I’ve learned about life by observing the ENTP200,ENFJ,personality types but then you're also

"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)15",ESTJc,life could be summed up in three
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)16",ESTJc,different phases phase one was when I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)17",ESTJc,was this goody-goody Christian girl who
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)18",ESTJc,never wanted to do anything wrong phase
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)19",ESTJc,two was I didn't care anymore I rebelled

"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)22",ESTJc,knowing where I was going
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)23",ESTJc,phase three was the aftermath and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)24",ESTJc,realizing and embracing that I am a
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)25",ESTJc,child of God and that there was nothing
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)26",ESTJc,that could take that away from me and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)27",ESTJc,with all three phases something that has
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)28",ESTJc,always kind of loomed over my life and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)29",ESTJc,my family has been financial issues
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)30",ESTJc,finances have really played a big part

"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)40",ESTJc,everyone we tried to make everyone happy
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)41",ESTJc,and I would pray every single night and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)42",ESTJc,I remember I couldn't even go to sleep
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)43",ESTJc,unless I prayed because I just felt like
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)44",ESTJc,I needed to talk to God and if I did it
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)45",ESTJc,and I forgot I felt like oh my gosh what
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)46",ESTJc,if God gets mad at me and then I don't
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)47",ESTJc,get to go to heaven so that was pretty
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)48",ESTJc,much how I always thought was I need to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)49",ESTJc,do good and be a good person and then I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)50",ESTJc,get to go to heaven and be with Jesus
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)51",ESTJc,so in middle school I was the Christian
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)52",ESTJc,club president and most of my friends
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)53",ESTJc,were a part of the club and I was just
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)54",ESTJc,kind of you know do many short Bible
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)55",ESTJc,studies and it was just as part of my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)56",ESTJc,life where I just always tried to be
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)57",ESTJc,good and my dad didn't let me have a
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)58",ESTJc,boyfriend until I was 18 years old and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)59",ESTJc,so even if I had crushes on people or if
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)60",ESTJc,we like like liked someone I couldn't
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)61",ESTJc,really do anything about it because I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)62",ESTJc,listen to my dad as much as I could it
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)63",ESTJc,wasn't until high school I started
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)64",ESTJc,realizing that my parents might be
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)65",ESTJc,struggling financially because my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)66",ESTJc,parents started asking to borrow money
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)67",ESTJc,from me and I didn't have a job at the
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)68",ESTJc,time I had just saved pretty much
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)69",ESTJc,everything I had ever gotten from a
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)70",ESTJc,relative and I would just you know save
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)71",ESTJc,it in a little pocket that I made I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)72",ESTJc,decided to get a job I got a job at Ben
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)73",ESTJc,& Jerry's ice cream and that was the
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)74",ESTJc,first job I ever had
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)75",ESTJc,I also got my license when I was fifteen
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)76",ESTJc,and a half so I pretty much did
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)77",ESTJc,everything the second that I could but I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)78",ESTJc,didn't have enough money for a car so
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)79",ESTJc,then I went to his high school that had
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)80",ESTJc,"4,000 students and I joined the"
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)81",ESTJc,Christian Club and I became a small
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)82",ESTJc,group leader where I was in charge of
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)83",ESTJc,you know holding some people accountable
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)84",ESTJc,and you know praying for people and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)85",ESTJc,inviting my friends it was just a very
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)86",ESTJc,safe bubble that I lived in and most of
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)87",ESTJc,my friends actually went to church as
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)88",ESTJc,well and so every Saturday we had youth
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)89",ESTJc,group and on Sundays we would go to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)90",ESTJc,church now it's just kind of my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)91",ESTJc,safety net and then my senior year of
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)92",ESTJc,high school hit and that's where
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)93",ESTJc,everything just kind of fell apart in my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)94",ESTJc,life I got my first boyfriend and I was
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)95",ESTJc,17 and a half at the time and so I had
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)96",ESTJc,about six months before I could tell my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)97",ESTJc,dad and all of his friends were partying
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)98",ESTJc,and drinking and you know going out
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)99",ESTJc,every weekend my circle of friends
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)100",ESTJc,started diving into that as well and so
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)101",ESTJc,I just felt very confused and I felt
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)102",ESTJc,like I needed to participate and I was
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)103",ESTJc,also very curious about it because it
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)104",ESTJc,just seemed like you know I'm not
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)105",ESTJc,supposed to be doing this but everyone
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)106",ESTJc,seems to be having so much fun and I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)107",ESTJc,don't want to miss out so I'm going to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)108",ESTJc,do it too my parents are also never home
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)109",ESTJc,because they were always working and so
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)110",ESTJc,I just felt like my friends for now my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)111",ESTJc,life and then my senior year of high
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)112",ESTJc,school I had my new boyfriend my friends
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)113",ESTJc,were all partying my parents got their
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)114",ESTJc,car impounded so I remember one morning
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)115",ESTJc,my mom was supposed to take me to school
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)116",ESTJc,and we saw the truck and they came to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)117",ESTJc,take the car and I begged the person can
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)118",ESTJc,my mom just take me to school
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)119",ESTJc,can I did she just drive the car to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)120",ESTJc,school and then you could take the car
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)121",ESTJc,and he said no and so I started crying
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)122",ESTJc,and I thought this is so embarrassing
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)123",ESTJc,how am I gonna go to school and then the
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)124",ESTJc,person said he would take me to school
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)125",ESTJc,in the you know tow truck even then I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)126",ESTJc,went to school crying my eyes out
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)127",ESTJc,because my parents had their car taken
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)128",ESTJc,away because they couldn't make payments
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)129",ESTJc,thereafter
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)130",ESTJc,I just thought I need to work harder I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)131",ESTJc,needed you know work more for I was
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)132",ESTJc,going to graduate from high school
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)133",ESTJc,trying to open my door and I couldn't
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)134",ESTJc,get in and I talked about this in my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)135",ESTJc,fiction video but basically my family
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)136",ESTJc,and I got evicted and my dad wasn't able
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)137",ESTJc,to pay the rent for five months and I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)138",ESTJc,know you might be thinking how can
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)139",ESTJc,someone not pay for five months well I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)140",ESTJc,see it as what a blessing that I had a
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)141",ESTJc,place to live for those five months
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)142",ESTJc,considering they really could have
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)143",ESTJc,kicked us out earlier typically with
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)144",ESTJc,evictions what happens is you get kicked
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)145",ESTJc,out and the Landlord wants the money
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)146",ESTJc,that you owe them and then you you just
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)147",ESTJc,kind of settle it but we didn't have
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)148",ESTJc,any money and so I didn't know what to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)149",ESTJc,do and I was like oh my gosh I'm
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)150",ESTJc,graduating soon and I was crying and I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)151",ESTJc,just thought God why would he do this to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)152",ESTJc,me like why would you do this to my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)153",ESTJc,family and my mom's friend helped us and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)154",ESTJc,so we were able to stay in like a motel
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)155",ESTJc,until we were able to move again I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)156",ESTJc,decided to go to UC Riverside because
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)157",ESTJc,they gave me a pretty darn good
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)158",ESTJc,financial aid package and UC Riverside
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)159",ESTJc,is where I really lost who I was as a
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)160",ESTJc,person long gone were the days of this
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)161",ESTJc,goody goody two-shoes Christian girl and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)162",ESTJc,here came this really lost person who
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)163",ESTJc,felt like God had just abandoned me and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)164",ESTJc,I felt like if God was so good then why
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)165",ESTJc,do all these bad things keep happening
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)166",ESTJc,in my life I'm getting kicked out of
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)167",ESTJc,your house and not get being able to get
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)168",ESTJc,inside and having to borrow my friends
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)169",ESTJc,clothes because I couldn't get my own
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)170",ESTJc,clothes it was pretty traumatizing so I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)171",ESTJc,went off to college you know partying
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)172",ESTJc,and doing whatever I could to fill this
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)173",ESTJc,void I had in my heart and I just felt
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)174",ESTJc,so unstable as a person and so how could
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)175",ESTJc,you have a stable relationship when I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)176",ESTJc,myself was feeling very insecure inside
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)177",ESTJc,and so we were we broke up probably like
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)178",ESTJc,five or six times over and over again
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)179",ESTJc,because I didn't know what I was doing
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)180",ESTJc,and he didn't know what he was doing so
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)181",ESTJc,that was really intense and after the
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)182",ESTJc,first breakup I was completely depressed
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)183",ESTJc,I thought that's something that would
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)184",ESTJc,last forever didn't and I just felt like
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)185",ESTJc,I I can't even begin to describe
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)186",ESTJc,depression it's pretty much like you
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)187",ESTJc,just don't care anymore you don't care
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)188",ESTJc,about anything and I would wake up every
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)189",ESTJc,day and just I wouldn't I couldn't wait
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)190",ESTJc,until my day was over and so to get my
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)191",ESTJc,day over with I would take naps and I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)192",ESTJc,would sleep for a very long time so I
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)193",ESTJc,would sleep for about 14 hours and then
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)194",ESTJc,I would take a two to three hour nap
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)195",ESTJc,during the day as well I tried to go to
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)196",ESTJc,some of my classes
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)197",ESTJc,but sometimes I would just skip them and
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)198",ESTJc,I just wouldn't care I also didn't eat
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)199",ESTJc,and so I turned anorexic without even
"ESTJc_My Testimony (jail, depression, and God’s perfect provision)200",ESTJc,realizing I was anorexic because I was
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment0,ENTJ,[Music]
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment1,ENTJ,so I recently sold pretty much
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment2,ENTJ,everything that I own let me explain
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment3,ENTJ,last month I moved to the city of
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment4,ENTJ,Philadelphia with the intentions of
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment5,ENTJ,simplifying my life I found that as I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment6,ENTJ,moved from apartment to apartment in the
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment7,ENTJ,past few years that I started to really
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment8,ENTJ,acquire a lot of stuff and there's
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment9,ENTJ,really no other way to put it than just
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment10,ENTJ,stuff
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment11,ENTJ,multiple blenders slap chops Christmas
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment12,ENTJ,gifts that I got from my uncle four
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment13,ENTJ,years ago and a number of those as seen
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment14,ENTJ,on tv items that are supposed to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment15,ENTJ,simplify your life but I found that as I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment16,ENTJ,moved around and moved into these new
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment17,ENTJ,places that having more stuff didn't
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment18,ENTJ,necessarily make my life any better and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment19,ENTJ,I noticed that in America especially
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment20,ENTJ,where we're so materialistic where we
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment21,ENTJ,just keep acquiring thing for one of the
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment22,ENTJ,only places in the world where we have
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment23,ENTJ,so much stuff to the point where we have
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment24,ENTJ,to go and rent storage units somewhere
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment25,ENTJ,else to store our great uncle's couch
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment26,ENTJ,from the 1930s that will probably never
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment27,ENTJ,use so I found that overall as I started
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment28,ENTJ,to get more stuff my quality of life
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment29,ENTJ,actually started to decrease and it's
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment30,ENTJ,not that I've ever had a problem with
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment31,ENTJ,the quality of my life I've always been
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment32,ENTJ,very happy but I noticed that when I was
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment33,ENTJ,getting more my life wasn't getting any
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment34,ENTJ,better necessarily and it's difficult to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment35,ENTJ,put a measurement on happiness but I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment36,ENTJ,noticed that as I started to scale back
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment37,ENTJ,when I moved into this new apartment
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment38,ENTJ,I really had quite an effect on myself
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment39,ENTJ,so this is what I really discovered
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment40,ENTJ,something called minimalism which is
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment41,ENTJ,scaling back the items that you have and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment42,ENTJ,really focusing on the things in life
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment43,ENTJ,that do add value to your life so in the
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment44,ENTJ,next few minutes I want to show you
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment45,ENTJ,around my apartment and I want to show
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment46,ENTJ,you some of the things that I did away
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment47,ENTJ,with things that I just found that I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment48,ENTJ,don't need that aren't necessary to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment49,ENTJ,improving the quality of my life and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment50,ENTJ,then also some items that bring joy to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment51,ENTJ,my life some things that I find to be
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment52,ENTJ,very valuable and useful throughout my
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment53,ENTJ,everyday life so let's go do that now
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment54,ENTJ,but first I think we should start this
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment55,ENTJ,video however
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment56,ENTJ,the apartment tour video starts and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment57,ENTJ,that's at the front door so let's go do
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment58,ENTJ,that now Oh what's going on so uh I'll
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment59,ENTJ,show you around the kitchen a little bit
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment60,ENTJ,this is it you know this is pretty much
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment61,ENTJ,all we have here the first thing you
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment62,ENTJ,might notice is that I don't really have
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment63,ENTJ,many appliances and there's a reason for
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment64,ENTJ,it you know I noticed that people in
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment65,ENTJ,their lives they'll have on their
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment66,ENTJ,kitchen counter they'll have a toaster
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment67,ENTJ,they'll have a microwave they'll have an
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment68,ENTJ,oven they'll have all these different
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment69,ENTJ,sources of heating something and I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment70,ENTJ,realize that all you really need is just
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment71,ENTJ,a stove so this is a gas stove it's
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment72,ENTJ,pretty nice but you know if I want to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment73,ENTJ,heat something up I just use the stove I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment74,ENTJ,don't need a microwave I don't need to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment75,ENTJ,use a toaster to make toast I just use
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment76,ENTJ,the pan and it really just works out
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment77,ENTJ,pretty well so at some point next week
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment78,ENTJ,we'll make a video about how I end up
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment79,ENTJ,eating you know thirty to forty dollars
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment80,ENTJ,of food per week I'm pretty cost
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment81,ENTJ,effective when it comes to making food I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment82,ENTJ,make all of my food at home in this
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment83,ENTJ,kitchen and one of the best things about
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment84,ENTJ,it is that I keep the counter very very
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment85,ENTJ,clear so I don't like having so many
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment86,ENTJ,different things on there
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment87,ENTJ,and it kind of stresses me out in a way
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment88,ENTJ,where I've been in apartments in the
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment89,ENTJ,past where there's six people in three
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment90,ENTJ,bedrooms and the kitchen counter is
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment91,ENTJ,absolutely destroyed there's like raw
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment92,ENTJ,chicken everywhere is absolutely
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment93,ENTJ,disgusting so I like to keep it very
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment94,ENTJ,simple very clear but you'll notice that
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment95,ENTJ,okay I do have a couple of things here
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment96,ENTJ,like this blender for example but that's
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment97,ENTJ,because I use it every single day so
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment98,ENTJ,this is something that I can't go
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment99,ENTJ,without but then there's other items
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment100,ENTJ,like say a coffee pot that I don't
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment101,ENTJ,really have any use for now maybe that's
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment102,ENTJ,just me being lazy I'm not quite sure
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment103,ENTJ,but usually when I make coffee I just
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment104,ENTJ,put some coffee grounds into the cup and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment105,ENTJ,drink it like that you just wait for the
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment106,ENTJ,coffee grounds to settle I don't know
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment107,ENTJ,does that make me weird I'm not sure in
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment108,ENTJ,mine a little bit but I don't know
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment109,ENTJ,that's what I do alright so let me show
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment110,ENTJ,you the living room here you'll notice
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment111,ENTJ,that it's pretty simple and you know I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment112,ENTJ,found that there's a lot of things that
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment113,ENTJ,I just don't really need but there's
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment114,ENTJ,also things that you know I'm willing to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment115,ENTJ,spend less money on and then
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment116,ENTJ,items that'll pay more money for so for
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment117,ENTJ,example this couch right here as far as
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment118,ENTJ,couches go it's relatively inexpensive
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment119,ENTJ,this is about $400 for this couch which
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment120,ENTJ,if you've ever bought sofas in the past
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment121,ENTJ,new you'll know that that's pretty cheap
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment122,ENTJ,you can pay a thousand two thousand
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment123,ENTJ,dollars for a sofa but honestly it
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment124,ENTJ,doesn't really make much of a difference
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment125,ENTJ,to me I think it's pretty comfortable
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment126,ENTJ,and I'm not very picky about it maybe
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment127,ENTJ,that's just cuz I'm 21 years old and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment128,ENTJ,just out of college I don't really care
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment129,ENTJ,too much but I'm pretty satisfied with
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment130,ENTJ,this purchase and hopefully I'll have it
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment131,ENTJ,for the next couple of years but then
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment132,ENTJ,you'll notice some things that I will
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment133,ENTJ,pay a little bit more money for
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment134,ENTJ,something like these speakers over here
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment135,ENTJ,which I paid a couple hundred dollars
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment136,ENTJ,for and you know some people say what
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment137,ENTJ,the hell is going on here you talk about
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment138,ENTJ,saving money and then you spend $200 on
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment139,ENTJ,speakers but I honestly think that they
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment140,ENTJ,really make me happy
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment141,ENTJ,I love listening to music that I love
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment142,ENTJ,just blasting music in here and they're
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment143,ENTJ,pretty thick walls so the neighbors
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment144,ENTJ,don't really care too much I think I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment145,ENTJ,don't know I haven't got any reports yet
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment146,ENTJ,but this TV you know I do like watching
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment147,ENTJ,the news in the morning usually for the
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment148,ENTJ,first thirty minutes so I'm eating my
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment149,ENTJ,breakfast after I make different types
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment150,ENTJ,of food I'll probably put that video out
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment151,ENTJ,maybe next week about how I really live
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment152,ENTJ,on thirty to forty dollars a week on all
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment153,ENTJ,of my groceries so make sure you
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment154,ENTJ,subscribe to the channel for that but
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment155,ENTJ,this TV I got from my friend he's moving
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment156,ENTJ,to LA and he didn't need it anymore and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment157,ENTJ,he gave it to me so that's why I have it
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment158,ENTJ,I'd probably would have gotten a smaller
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment159,ENTJ,one I think it's kind of a little bit
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment160,ENTJ,large it's the only thing that really
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment161,ENTJ,doesn't really fit this room very well
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment162,ENTJ,that I don't like as much but everything
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment163,ENTJ,else I got for a purpose and you know
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment164,ENTJ,it's nice to have an extra chair in here
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment165,ENTJ,and I guess when have some people over
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment166,ENTJ,and I had my little plant friend over
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment167,ENTJ,here it's pretty cool alright so let me
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment168,ENTJ,show you my room you know I don't have
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment169,ENTJ,very much in here a couple reasons for
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment170,ENTJ,it I did just move here not too long ago
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment171,ENTJ,the only problem with this apartment is
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment172,ENTJ,that it's a little bit echoey because I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment173,ENTJ,don't have very much stuff but yeah so
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment174,ENTJ,this is the room you know a bed is the
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment175,ENTJ,one item that I think is important to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment176,ENTJ,pay quite a bit of money for so I paid
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment177,ENTJ,over a thousand dollars for this bed and
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment178,ENTJ,some people will say you're crazy what
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment179,ENTJ,are you doing that's a lot of money you
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment180,ENTJ,talk about saving money right and you're
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment181,ENTJ,buying expensive
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment182,ENTJ,"speakers and mattresses that are $1,000"
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment183,ENTJ,but I really did this for a purpose
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment184,ENTJ,because if you look over here you see
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment185,ENTJ,this weird-looking homemade type desk
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment186,ENTJ,and that's because I built that desk
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment187,ENTJ,when I was 12 years old and I probably
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment188,ENTJ,paid $5 in bolts and found the wood
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment189,ENTJ,laying around my house so it like I said
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment190,ENTJ,earlier it really does come down to
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment191,ENTJ,finding the things that do provide you
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment192,ENTJ,more value and then this desk I mean
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment193,ENTJ,it's just a slab of wood I don't really
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment194,ENTJ,carry you know you can buy a thousand
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment195,ENTJ,dollar desk and it's still a slab of
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment196,ENTJ,wood versus a five dollar desk and it
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment197,ENTJ,gets the same thing done I mean I've
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment198,ENTJ,made thousands of dollars using that
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment199,ENTJ,piece of wood but then this bed I
ENTJ_My Minimalist Apartment200,ENTJ,noticed that when I was in high school I
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test0,ISFJ,hi everyone i'm angie from psychology

ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test19,ISFJ,taken it seriously a design been
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test20,ISFJ,thinking about taking it again I was
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test21,ISFJ,just procrastinating about it
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test22,ISFJ,noise so I'm going to take it again now
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test23,ISFJ,and I thought I'll be more serious now
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test24,ISFJ,that I have a camera in front of me
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test25,ISFJ,right let's do it so Who am I well I

ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test32,ISFJ,about that I am on the sixteen
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test33,ISFJ,personalities comes the first result
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test34,ISFJ,that I got on Google it says free tests
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test35,ISFJ,takes less than 12 minutes and start

ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test37,ISFJ,answer well that's a great life advice
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test38,ISFJ,try not to leave neutral answers yeah
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test39,ISFJ,basically don't be that guy the first
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test40,ISFJ,question is you enjoy vibrant social
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test41,ISFJ,events with lots of people that's a good
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test42,ISFJ,one strongly disagree if your friend is
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test43,ISFJ,sad about something your first instinct
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test44,ISFJ,is to support them emotionally not try
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test45,ISFJ,to solve their problem okay I will try
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test46,ISFJ,to find a solution rather than support
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test47,ISFJ,them emotionally because I think that I
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test48,ISFJ,would really be there for someone when I
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test49,ISFJ,do something for them and when I go to
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test50,ISFJ,someone named sad I would need them to
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test51,ISFJ,help me find a solution and if I can
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test52,ISFJ,implement it myself then I would love it
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test53,ISFJ,if they could help me with that so I
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test54,ISFJ,will go with mine Lee agree people can
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test55,ISFJ,rarely upset you know it's pretty easy
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test56,ISFJ,to upset me actually like this
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test57,ISFJ,flatterers video right there pretty sure
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test58,ISFJ,almost I mean there are some details to
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test59,ISFJ,be worked out sure but the basic concept
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test60,ISFJ,is sound absolutely sound often rely on
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test61,ISFJ,other people to be the ones to start a
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test62,ISFJ,conversation and keep it up I just want
ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test63,ISFJ,to say thank you to all my extroverted

ISFJ_Revealing my MBTI type after taking the 16personalities test69,ISFJ,started meditating like four years ago

ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?67,ESTPc,still in the early stages I don't see

ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?71,ESTPc,terms of AI machine learning I don't see
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?72,ESTPc,it as a freelancer thing yet it kind of
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?73,ESTPc,reminds me of web design and development
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?74,ESTPc,in 1994 it really started to take off in
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?75,ESTPc,96 97 in terms of freelancing because
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?76,ESTPc,remember back in the day when I started
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?77,ESTPc,freelancing I think it was 96 it's
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?78,ESTPc,actually 95 in fact a lot of times I
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?79,ESTPc,would approach companies and they would
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?80,ESTPc,I would say she get a web site and they
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?81,ESTPc,would say what's what's a web site they
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?82,ESTPc,didn't know machine learning AI people
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?83,ESTPc,know what it is but we don't exactly
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?84,ESTPc,know exactly how it's going to be
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?85,ESTPc,implemented in a small business context
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?86,ESTPc,a large business of course would be
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?87,ESTPc,hiring people full-time so it's not
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?88,ESTPc,necessarily a free lapsing although they
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?89,ESTPc,could hire freelance contractors to take
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?90,ESTPc,care of some AI machine learning stuff
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?91,ESTPc,that they may need to do if you learn

ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?93,ESTPc,web stack and then on the side start
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?94,ESTPc,learning about machine learning
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?95,ESTPc,opportunities there are libraries and
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?96,ESTPc,frameworks that you can leverage so you
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?97,ESTPc,don't have to do a deep dive into
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?98,ESTPc,machine learning but generally speaking
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?99,ESTPc,I think these days if a web is in terms
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?100,ESTPc,of freelancing is the way to go so I
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?101,ESTPc,gave the first reason why web
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?102,ESTPc,freelancing is big because websites are
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?103,ESTPc,just getting more and more important
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?104,ESTPc,because
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?105,ESTPc,there's so many independent contractors
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?106,ESTPc,out there and small business owners
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?107,ESTPc,there's a period four or five years ago
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?108,ESTPc,give or take where people are looking at
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?109,ESTPc,websites as being less important they
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?110,ESTPc,were looking at better to build your
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?111,ESTPc,social media presence like on Facebook
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?112,ESTPc,or something but things have changed
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?113,ESTPc,we've seen how Facebook can take people
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?114,ESTPc,down they ultimately control your
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?115,ESTPc,presence on their platform so smart
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?116,ESTPc,business owners and all business owners
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?117,ESTPc,trying to realize it's much better to
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?118,ESTPc,have your own website your own space on
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?119,ESTPc,the web and then have satellite Facebook
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?120,ESTPc,presence Instagram presence YouTube
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?121,ESTPc,presence and so on so I think there's
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?122,ESTPc,going to be a continued rise in the
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?123,ESTPc,importance of web design development web
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?124,ESTPc,professionals as they call them because
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?125,ESTPc,the skill sets of a modern web
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?126,ESTPc,freelancer is shifting slowly but surely
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?127,ESTPc,shifting but it was in the 90s is very
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?128,ESTPc,different from early 2000s very
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?129,ESTPc,different from well kind of different
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?130,ESTPc,from mid late 2000s it's pretty stable
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?131,ESTPc,but there are new things coming into
ESTPc_Is Freelance Web Design Still Viable in 2019-2020?132,ESTPc,play now so there you go I hope that

"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College31",ESFJc,really random things like uno cards I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College32",ESFJc,buy camera gear I buy old computers and
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College33",ESFJc,basically I just buy them local and then
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College34",ESFJc,sell them online all my friends were
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College35",ESFJc,working at like the mall or at a
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College36",ESFJc,restaurant I actually worked at a
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College37",ESFJc,restaurant for a little bit too but this
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College38",ESFJc,was making such good money that I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College39",ESFJc,stopped working there and I was able to
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College40",ESFJc,make a good amount as a high school
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College41",ESFJc,student it's really not that hard you
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College42",ESFJc,just kind of buy things that people are
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College43",ESFJc,selling you get it for a low price and
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College44",ESFJc,then sell it for higher I think I made
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College45",ESFJc,something like over ten thousand dollars
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College46",ESFJc,over the time that I was flipping and
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College47",ESFJc,reselling and one week in college I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College48",ESFJc,actually made over a thousand two
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College49",ESFJc,hundred dollars of profit off of just
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College50",ESFJc,like a few items that I flipped I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College51",ESFJc,already made a video on this if you guys
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College52",ESFJc,want to check it out I'll put it
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College53",ESFJc,somewhere here but the issue with
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College54",ESFJc,flipping and reselling is time you have
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College55",ESFJc,to spend a ton of time online looking
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College56",ESFJc,for products and then you have to
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College57",ESFJc,actually go out and meet people and then
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College58",ESFJc,you have to go list them online take
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College59",ESFJc,photos and then you have to actually
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College60",ESFJc,ship them out it's just the whole
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College61",ESFJc,process and it takes up a lot of time
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College62",ESFJc,and when I went off to college I didn't
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College63",ESFJc,have a lot of time and I was trying to
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College64",ESFJc,focus on classes not the best way to
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College65",ESFJc,make money
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College66",ESFJc,and so I ended up looking for some
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College67",ESFJc,scalable ways to sell things online like
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College68",ESFJc,I was with flipping and I came across
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College69",ESFJc,this thing called Amazon FBA so amazon
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College70",ESFJc,FBA is amazon fulfillment by Amazon and
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College71",ESFJc,basically what it is is people will get
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College72",ESFJc,products sell them on Amazon and Amazon
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College73",ESFJc,will take care of the shipping the
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College74",ESFJc,handling and the customer service
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College75",ESFJc,basically everything dealing with the
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College76",ESFJc,actual products and that's not an
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College77",ESFJc,amazing to me because it sounded like it
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College78",ESFJc,would save me a lot of time and I can
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College79",ESFJc,basically just pay Amazon to do a lot of
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College80",ESFJc,the dirty work now the business is a
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College81",ESFJc,little bit different because you buy in
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College82",ESFJc,both you have your own product you make
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College83",ESFJc,it your own
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College84",ESFJc,it's basically you're starting your own
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College85",ESFJc,private label brand it sounded really
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College86",ESFJc,interesting to me and I saw a lot of
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College87",ESFJc,people making a lot of money from it so
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College88",ESFJc,I decided to give it a shot my freshman
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College89",ESFJc,year of college
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College90",ESFJc,so with Amazon FBA you're gonna see a
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College91",ESFJc,trend here but usually you're selling
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College92",ESFJc,really random products because the
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College93",ESFJc,popular products that everyone else
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College94",ESFJc,sells it's usually pretty competitive so
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College95",ESFJc,my first product ever my first attempt
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College96",ESFJc,at Amazon FBA was with felt leather
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College97",ESFJc,boards I'll try to find a photo of the
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College98",ESFJc,actual products that I sold so I'll put
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College99",ESFJc,it up right here
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College100",ESFJc,but I ended up trying to sell these my
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College101",ESFJc,freshman year and I feel I worked my ass
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College102",ESFJc,off I didn't go to parties every time I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College103",ESFJc,finished my homework and finish up with
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College104",ESFJc,class I would go to the library and just
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College105",ESFJc,do research for the entire day and I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College106",ESFJc,"still ended up losing around $2,000"
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College107",ESFJc,which is a lot of money for a college
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College108",ESFJc,student but I was super motivated and I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College109",ESFJc,learned a lot from that first failure so
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College110",ESFJc,I decided to give it another shot this
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College111",ESFJc,time I decided to sell TOEFL holders I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College112",ESFJc,know in a super super random and people
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College113",ESFJc,always give me a weird look whenever I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College114",ESFJc,say it but those are the types of
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College115",ESFJc,products that do well for Amazon FBA so
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College116",ESFJc,I did all the hard stuff I found
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College117",ESFJc,suppliers in China I had my
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College118",ESFJc,manufacturers customized my product I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College119",ESFJc,did everything I needed to do and then
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College120",ESFJc,had the products shipped over to the US
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College121",ESFJc,and sent to the Amazon warehouses when
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College122",ESFJc,my two thousand topple holders arrived
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College123",ESFJc,at the Amazon warehouses that's when my
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College124",ESFJc,first youtube video started to blow up
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College125",ESFJc,and when I say the video blew up
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College126",ESFJc,I mean I had a hundred subscribers and
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College127",ESFJc,within the first few days I had a
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College128",ESFJc,thousand views
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College129",ESFJc,"by the end of the week I had 10,000 and"
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College130",ESFJc,then by the end of the next week I had
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College131",ESFJc,20 and then 30 and then 40 and it wasn't
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College132",ESFJc,stopping at that point in time I had to
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College133",ESFJc,make a really important decision I was a
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College134",ESFJc,college student at the time and my video
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College135",ESFJc,was blow me up
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College136",ESFJc,I could either choose to ride this wave
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College137",ESFJc,on YouTube and see where it takes me or
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College138",ESFJc,do the logical thing and work on the
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College139",ESFJc,business because I've been working on it
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College140",ESFJc,for two months three months now and my
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College141",ESFJc,inventory it just arrived it was time
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College142",ESFJc,for launch
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College143",ESFJc,so I decided to really focus on the
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College144",ESFJc,YouTube videos and I put aside my
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College145",ESFJc,business I basically just left all 2000
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College146",ESFJc,of my tonfa holders at the Amazon
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College147",ESFJc,warehouses and they were just stranded
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College148",ESFJc,there I kind of forgot about them but
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College149",ESFJc,not really you guys probably can't
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College150",ESFJc,relate to this feeling but the burden of
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College151",ESFJc,"having $10,000 worth of TOEFL holders in"
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College152",ESFJc,warehouses across the country is just
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College153",ESFJc,insane it was so stressful for me but I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College154",ESFJc,was really terrible at dealing with it I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College155",ESFJc,just kept on putting it off I was just
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College156",ESFJc,making youtube videos I was like you
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College157",ESFJc,know what I'll worry about this later
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College158",ESFJc,when it's a bigger issue I just kept
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College159",ESFJc,putting it off putting off putting it
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College160",ESFJc,off I basically just assumed that all
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College161",ESFJc,the money that I put into my business
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College162",ESFJc,was lost and I was just making videos
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College163",ESFJc,until I was about to get hit with
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College164",ESFJc,massive fees from Amazon for keeping my
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College165",ESFJc,inventory in their warehouses and when I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College166",ESFJc,say massive fees I'm talking like
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College167",ESFJc,thousands and thousands and thousands of
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College168",ESFJc,dollars in fees so it was about to get
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College169",ESFJc,really really bad so I reached out to my
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College170",ESFJc,friend Samer who sells full-time on
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College171",ESFJc,Amazon and he basically set up some ads
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College172",ESFJc,for me we lowered the price a ton to get
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College173",ESFJc,rid of this inventory before I got hit
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College174",ESFJc,with these fees so this is where it gets
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College175",ESFJc,crazy
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College176",ESFJc,the day after Samer sets up some
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College177",ESFJc,campaigns for me and we have some ads
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College178",ESFJc,running I get a few sales and I'm
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College179",ESFJc,ecstatic because my taco holders are
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College180",ESFJc,finally selling every single night I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College181",ESFJc,went to sleep I woke up and I had a few
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College182",ESFJc,sales and then throughout the day I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College183",ESFJc,would get a notification saying a few
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College184",ESFJc,sales had been made and so within the
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College185",ESFJc,first week or so I had about 16 units
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College186",ESFJc,sold by the second week things really
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College187",ESFJc,picked up and I sold over two thousand
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College188",ESFJc,dollars worth of the taco holders now
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College189",ESFJc,you guys know where this is heading
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College190",ESFJc,"but by week three I sold over $8,000"
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College191",ESFJc,worth of the taco holders and I was
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College192",ESFJc,officially sold out but if you remember
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College193",ESFJc,what I was saying I was doing anything I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College194",ESFJc,could to really get these products out
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College195",ESFJc,of these Amazon warehouses because I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College196",ESFJc,didn't want to get hit with the feeds I
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College197",ESFJc,lowered the price of ton on my products
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College198",ESFJc,from my original sale price and although
"ESFJc_How I made $8,000 in THREE weeks of College199",ESFJc,I did eight thousand dollars in sales

ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome0,ENFJc,hello there and welcome have a seat and
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome1,ENFJc,let's have a little conversation so I've
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome2,ENFJc,called you here today to express to you
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome3,ENFJc,why you should be proud that you're an
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome4,ENFJc,ISTJ
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome5,ENFJc,or why people who don't know is DJs
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome6,ENFJc,should probably try to get to know some
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome7,ENFJc,is tjs so let's first talk about what is
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome8,ENFJc,an ISTJ you could look at the letter s'
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome9,ENFJc,introverted sensing thinking judging
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome10,ENFJc,that doesn't really mean much what
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome11,ENFJc,really matters is what's going on in
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome12,ENFJc,your mind in your brain so an is TJ has
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome13,ENFJc,introverted sensing extraverted thinking
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome14,ENFJc,introverted feeling and extroverted
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome15,ENFJc,judging so contrary to what many people
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome16,ENFJc,believe an honest TJ might actually be
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome17,ENFJc,more in touch with their emotions than a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome18,ENFJc,lot of people and you know you might not
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome19,ENFJc,talk about it that's fine you don't need
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome20,ENFJc,to talk about it but you're aware of
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome21,ENFJc,them but anyway we're not here to talk
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome22,ENFJc,about your emotions we're here to talk
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome23,ENFJc,about why you should be proud of
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome24,ENFJc,yourself
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome25,ENFJc,first of all you lead with introverted
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome26,ENFJc,sensing and this is a skill that a lot
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome27,ENFJc,of us do not have you have the ability
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome28,ENFJc,to organize all of your past experiences
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome29,ENFJc,and things that you've read about and
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome30,ENFJc,ideas that you've come across and you
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome31,ENFJc,kind of organize them and collect them
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome32,ENFJc,and prioritize them you're pretty good
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome33,ENFJc,at recognizing when a current experience
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome34,ENFJc,is like a past experience and what's
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome35,ENFJc,really great about that is if you're in
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome36,ENFJc,a situation like one that you've been in
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome37,ENFJc,the past where something bad happened
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome38,ENFJc,you're more likely to have a little
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome39,ENFJc,skepticism towards that situation you're
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome40,ENFJc,like hey I've seen these things before
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome41,ENFJc,this feels like it's gonna go down a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome42,ENFJc,pretty negative path if I follow through
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome43,ENFJc,with this and that's a really great
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome44,ENFJc,skill because a lot of people don't have
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome45,ENFJc,that ability a lot of people will go
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome46,ENFJc,through a situation that's exactly like
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome47,ENFJc,one that they've been through before
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome48,ENFJc,they didn't learn from that situation
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome49,ENFJc,in the past they're doing the exact same
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome50,ENFJc,thing that they did before they haven't
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome51,ENFJc,learned you is tjs you learn not always
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome52,ENFJc,there's exceptions to the rules but you
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome53,ENFJc,are the most likely of all types to
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome54,ENFJc,learn from a past experience UN is fj's
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome55,ENFJc,and I'll talk about ash is fj's later so
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome56,ENFJc,you're also good at routine does that
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome57,ENFJc,mean that everything in your life is a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome58,ENFJc,routine no that's a huge misconception
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome59,ENFJc,is DJs do not have everything as a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome60,ENFJc,routine but what's really cool is that
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome61,ENFJc,you can create routines relatively
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome62,ENFJc,easily you if you find a routine or a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome63,ENFJc,way of doing something that works you're
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome64,ENFJc,gonna stick to it and you're gonna keep
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome65,ENFJc,doing it and yeah you'll improve it here
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome66,ENFJc,and there as needed but you'll you'll
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome67,ENFJc,stick to that routine pretty well and
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome68,ENFJc,you'll see the benefit of sticking to
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome69,ENFJc,that routine it kind of goes along with
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome70,ENFJc,those past experiences you see things
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome71,ENFJc,that have happened in the past that work
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome72,ENFJc,and therefore you recreate them so that
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome73,ENFJc,they continue to work that's a very
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome74,ENFJc,awesome skill that again a lot of people
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome75,ENFJc,don't have I embedded that I'm really
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome76,ENFJc,bad at finding a routine and sticking to
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome77,ENFJc,it I could have a routine for like a day
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome78,ENFJc,or a week and then I'll get over it and
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome79,ENFJc,move on and never do it again so it's
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome80,ENFJc,not really a routine as that so you guys
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome81,ENFJc,are really great at that kind of thing
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome82,ENFJc,like I said you're not gonna have
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome83,ENFJc,everything in your life be a routine but
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome84,ENFJc,the routines that you have you're gonna
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome85,ENFJc,be pretty darn good at and there's gonna
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome86,ENFJc,be a purpose for them there's gonna be a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome87,ENFJc,reason for them and that's because you
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome88,ENFJc,have in your third slot introverted
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome89,ENFJc,feeling an introverted feeling is kind
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome90,ENFJc,of like an intuition about why you want
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome91,ENFJc,something or why something matters maybe
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome92,ENFJc,there isn't like a super logical reason
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome93,ENFJc,or whatever maybe there is but you know
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome94,ENFJc,what you want and why you want it so
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome95,ENFJc,your second function is really cool so
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome96,ENFJc,you have extroverted thinking as your
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome97,ENFJc,can't function and what this helps you
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome98,ENFJc,to do is to not only with your
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome99,ENFJc,introverted sensing create a routine but
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome100,ENFJc,you're gonna make that routine as
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome101,ENFJc,efficient as possible you're gonna waste
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome102,ENFJc,the least amount of energy possible I
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome103,ENFJc,know a lot of is tjs and one of my cool
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome104,ENFJc,friends at work he's an is TJ and he is
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome105,ENFJc,really great at finding ways to work
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome106,ENFJc,less not that he is doing less work he's
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome107,ENFJc,not putting in as much effort he's
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome108,ENFJc,really good at finding ways to put in
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome109,ENFJc,less effort and still get the same kind
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome110,ENFJc,of outcome and I think that's why is
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome111,ENFJc,TJ's often end up in a position where
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome112,ENFJc,they are doing the same thing over and
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome113,ENFJc,over because you're good at it you're
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome114,ENFJc,fast at it and you're repeating it so
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome115,ENFJc,you're you're dependable you can repeat
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome116,ENFJc,a task and you're also efficient with
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome117,ENFJc,your time and energy what people tend to
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome118,ENFJc,think about that from an outside
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome119,ENFJc,perspective is that you're boring which
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome120,ENFJc,I have not met a single boring is TJ out
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome121,ENFJc,there ever I have not and another thing
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome122,ENFJc,is people think that because you're an
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome123,ENFJc,IAS TJ you never talk huh that's also a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome124,ENFJc,laugh I have had some insane
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome125,ENFJc,conversations and loud conversations and
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome126,ENFJc,interesting conversations with is TJ's
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome127,ENFJc,because that past experience really
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome128,ENFJc,gives you a good understanding of life
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome129,ENFJc,like you really understand your own life
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome130,ENFJc,you understand the patterns and if
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome131,ENFJc,you're interested in history in the past
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome132,ENFJc,of humanity you can also recognize those
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome133,ENFJc,kind of patterns too and because you
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome134,ENFJc,have fourths lot extra and intuition
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome135,ENFJc,that means you can see the connections
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome136,ENFJc,between them and make a new connections
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome137,ENFJc,pretty easily but you're not going to do
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome138,ENFJc,that all the time because you think it's
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome139,ENFJc,pretty much a waste of time to
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome140,ENFJc,constantly look for new connections when
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome141,ENFJc,you can clearly see the past patterns
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome142,ENFJc,you can clearly see what's replicable
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome143,ENFJc,and what's not
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome144,ENFJc,and and you can't have these really
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome145,ENFJc,profound things to talk about but you
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome146,ENFJc,might think that it's a little bit of a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome147,ENFJc,waste of time sometimes it takes away
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome148,ENFJc,your energy from doing other things but
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome149,ENFJc,that extraverted intuition that you have
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome150,ENFJc,in the fourth slot means that those
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome151,ENFJc,ideas that you think about they're even
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome152,ENFJc,more profound than someone like me who
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome153,ENFJc,thinks about those kind of things
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome154,ENFJc,constantly and can't even create a

ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome158,ENFJc,happen and you don't focus your energy
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome159,ENFJc,on them you just let them come you might
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome160,ENFJc,talk about them you might just store
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome161,ENFJc,them away along with your other memories

ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome163,ENFJc,that's really a great skill to it means

ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome168,ENFJc,for the future you are you more likely
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome169,ENFJc,to not believe these ideas yeah because
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome170,ENFJc,you've seen things happen in the past
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome171,ENFJc,and you know how it's happened in the
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome172,ENFJc,past and you're not gonna be fooled and
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome173,ENFJc,that's another great thing about is tjs
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome174,ENFJc,you're not often fooled people have a
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome175,ENFJc,hard time fooling you because if you

ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome177,ENFJc,already stored your memories about them
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome178,ENFJc,and if they start doing something that
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome179,ENFJc,looks like something they've done in the
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome180,ENFJc,past

ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome190,ENFJc,into themselves but you know I also know
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome191,ENFJc,how that could kind of seem pointless ie
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome192,ENFJc,my entire channel might just be
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome193,ENFJc,pointless but
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome194,ENFJc,I think it would be really interesting
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome195,ENFJc,and I think people could learn a lot
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome196,ENFJc,because is tjs people have some serious
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome197,ENFJc,misconceptions about you guys like
ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome198,ENFJc,serious boring I have not met a boring

ENFJc_Why ISTJs are Awesome200,ENFJc,you might be pretty good at doing things
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...0,ISTJc,"Hey, what is going on, guys?"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...1,ISTJc,"One of the most common
questions I get asked"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...2,ISTJc,"about myself is what is my MBTI,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...3,ISTJc,Meyers Briggs personality type?
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...4,ISTJc,"I get this question all
the time, and, today,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...5,ISTJc,"I thought I would just
answer it by actually going"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...6,ISTJc,through the most popular personality test
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...7,ISTJc,"on the internet, the
16personalities.com test."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...8,ISTJc,"If you Google personality
test, I believe it is"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...9,ISTJc,"the first thing that comes
up, personality test."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...10,ISTJc,"Yes, first thing that comes up."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...11,ISTJc,"We're gonna take this test,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...12,ISTJc,and I'm going to show you my score.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...13,ISTJc,"Once we get whatever my
type is, we'll look through"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...14,ISTJc,some of the traits that that type contains
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...15,ISTJc,"and then compare it to some
of the other traits out there,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...16,ISTJc,"because there are, it looks like, 16"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...17,ISTJc,"different personality
types, each a combination"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...18,ISTJc,of the four different letters here.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...19,ISTJc,"Now, this is mainly
based on the Myers Briggs"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...20,ISTJc,"Personality Type Indicator acronym here,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...21,ISTJc,"but I believe that the
16 personalities test,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...22,ISTJc,"looking through their Theory page here,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...23,ISTJc,uses a little bit different philosophy
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...24,ISTJc,"behind their questions, and
there's lots of different types"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...25,ISTJc,"of tests that use the MBTI
acronyms, so it's important"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...26,ISTJc,"to realize that people who tell you,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...27,ISTJc,"""Hey, I'm an IM, INFTP
or ENTJ or an ENFJ,"""
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...28,ISTJc,"if they say that, they might
have taken a different test"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...29,ISTJc,"than the one you take, and it might mean"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...30,ISTJc,something different all together.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...31,ISTJc,"The other thing that I wanna
mention before I go into this"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...32,ISTJc,"is that personality tests in
general, this one and others,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...33,ISTJc,"are merely mental models
that can be useful"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...34,ISTJc,"for figuring out what kind
of personality you might have"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...35,ISTJc,"and what things you might
be better at than others,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...36,ISTJc,"but I don't think that
you should use these"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...37,ISTJc,to define yourself entirely.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...38,ISTJc,"In fact, there's a really
good quote from an article"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...39,ISTJc,"here on Quora called What
is the current thinking"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...40,ISTJc,"about Myers Briggs that
I really liked here"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...41,ISTJc,"in this fourth paragraph, I think it is."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...42,ISTJc,"In this sense, it can be a good framework"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...43,ISTJc,"for developing an intuition
about one's own uniqueness"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...44,ISTJc,and how one cannot use oneself as a model
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...45,ISTJc,to explain all other human beings.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...46,ISTJc,"That's the one quote
there that I really love."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...47,ISTJc,"You can use these tests
to remind yourself that"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...48,ISTJc,"the way you view the world is
not the way that other people"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...49,ISTJc,"view the world, and
things that work for you"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...50,ISTJc,"may not work for other
people, but I don't want you"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...51,ISTJc,"to use these kind of tests
to try to define yourself"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...52,ISTJc,and especially limit the choices you make
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...53,ISTJc,"or make decisions about
what you maybe shouldn't try"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...54,ISTJc,"to do, because you fit into a
certain personality archetype."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...55,ISTJc,"With all that being said, we
are just going to get into"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...56,ISTJc,the quiz here.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...57,ISTJc,"You find it difficult to introduce
yourself to other people."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...58,ISTJc,No.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...59,ISTJc,"It has become much, much
easier in recent years,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...60,ISTJc,"and I think this actually
highlights something right away."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...61,ISTJc,"If I were to take this
test; in fact, I did take"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...62,ISTJc,"this very test about
five years ago, I think."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...63,ISTJc,"This was more on the middle or agree side,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...64,ISTJc,"because I was a little bit more shy,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...65,ISTJc,and now it's not hard at all.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...66,ISTJc,"You try to respond to your
emails as soon as possible"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...67,ISTJc,and cannot stand a messy inbox.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...68,ISTJc,"Oh, boy."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...69,ISTJc,"Can we use wishful
thinking here as an answer?"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...70,ISTJc,You have to answer honestly
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...71,ISTJc,even if you don't like the answer.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...72,ISTJc,"Okay, I have seen friends of mine."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...73,ISTJc,"I've seen their inboxes, and
I sometimes see like 10,000"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...74,ISTJc,unread emails in there.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...75,ISTJc,I am not nearly that bad.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...76,ISTJc,"However, I am not super good at responding"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...77,ISTJc,to emails very quickly.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...78,ISTJc,"Let's go with a soft agree,
because I do try to do it,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...79,ISTJc,and I do not like a messy inbox.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...80,ISTJc,"I'm just not good at it,
and I'm not one of those"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...81,ISTJc,"inbox zero practitioners,
so I really don't think"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...82,ISTJc,"I could put myself over
here on the strong agree."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...83,ISTJc,You feel superior to other people.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...84,ISTJc,I don't even know how to answer that.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...85,ISTJc,"I definitely feel superior to
other people in certain areas,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...86,ISTJc,"but I am very confident
in my skill set, but,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...87,ISTJc,"in terms of just general,
I mean, I don't know."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...88,ISTJc,"I realize that it's very
easy to compare yourself"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...89,ISTJc,"to a reference that you may
have, but you may not have"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...90,ISTJc,"a reference somewhere else,
so I really don't know."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...91,ISTJc,"I feel like the type of
work I do lends itself"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...92,ISTJc,"to the development of an ego
that I try to keep in check."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...93,ISTJc,"I'm gonna go ahead, and I'm
gonna put that as neutral."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...94,ISTJc,"I'm not really sure, to be honest."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...95,ISTJc,Being organized is more important to you
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...96,ISTJc,than being adaptable.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...97,ISTJc,"No, no, no, no."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...98,ISTJc,"No, not at all."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...99,ISTJc,"I love being organized, absolutely."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...100,ISTJc,"Don't get me wrong, but I
think the skill of adaptability"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...101,ISTJc,"is actually a lot more
important than being organized."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...102,ISTJc,"Winning a debate matters
less to you than making sure"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...103,ISTJc,no one gets upset.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...104,ISTJc,"Now, this is an interesting question."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...105,ISTJc,"I think five years ago I
would've put that, yes,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...106,ISTJc,"winning a debate matters more,
because I was more interested"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...107,ISTJc,"in objective truth and
finding the right answer."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...108,ISTJc,"At this point, I think it
depends, because, like,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...109,ISTJc,"with my relationship with my girlfriend,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...110,ISTJc,"I often don't care if I
win a debate as many times"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...111,ISTJc,"as I may have used to, because
I don't want her to be upset."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...112,ISTJc,"These are tough questions,
because the context matters,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...113,ISTJc,"and I would rather be wrong
than win on an argument"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...114,ISTJc,"that doesn't work, so
this is kind of tough."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...115,ISTJc,"Maybe, putting aside the
context of my relationship"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...116,ISTJc,"with my girlfriend on
debates that don't matter,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...117,ISTJc,"in general, I think that coming
to the truth of the matter"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...118,ISTJc,"does matter more than making
sure no one gets upset."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...119,ISTJc,"Otherwise, that's avoidance
of conflict for no reason."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...120,ISTJc,We will go with a middle agree here.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...121,ISTJc,"You don't mind being at
the center of attention."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...122,ISTJc,Agree. I do not mind that.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...123,ISTJc,"You consider yourself more
practical than creative."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...124,ISTJc,"I think that I'm more
creative than practical,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...125,ISTJc,"and I suppose my reasoning
for this would be that"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...126,ISTJc,I have a lot of friends who do Youtube
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...127,ISTJc,"and do entrepreneurial things,
and a lot of those friends"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...128,ISTJc,"are more willing to do
things that they know"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...129,ISTJc,"are going to be profitable
with less of an investment"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...130,ISTJc,"in the creative aspects
whereas you guys know"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...131,ISTJc,"I put out a video once a week, if that,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...132,ISTJc,because I'm so into making sure that
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...133,ISTJc,"my videos have something
creative and new and different"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...134,ISTJc,in them every single time.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...135,ISTJc,I think I'm more creative than practical.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...136,ISTJc,We'll go with that one.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...137,ISTJc,People can rarely upset you.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...138,ISTJc,That is true.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...139,ISTJc,I don't really get upset almost ever.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...140,ISTJc,It is often difficult for you to relate
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...141,ISTJc,to other people's feelings.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...142,ISTJc,"I'm actually gonna go
to disagree on this one."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...143,ISTJc,It's gonna be a soft disagree.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...144,ISTJc,"When I took this test a few years ago,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...145,ISTJc,"probably five years ago at this point,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...146,ISTJc,"I know that I was over
here on the agree side."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...147,ISTJc,I have had trouble in the past empathizing
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...148,ISTJc,"with other people's feelings,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...149,ISTJc,because I'm a very solution-minded person.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...150,ISTJc,"When there's a problem,
at least in my mind,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...151,ISTJc,"the first thing to do is to solve it,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...152,ISTJc,but I think this is another good example
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...153,ISTJc,of how your personality can actually shift
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...154,ISTJc,"through conscious effort,
because I have worked"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...155,ISTJc,to become more empathetic with my friends
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...156,ISTJc,"and with people in general,
and I think that work"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...157,ISTJc,has actually contributed to me becoming
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...158,ISTJc,more naturally empathetic.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...159,ISTJc,We're gonna go with a soft disagree there.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...160,ISTJc,"In a discussion, truth
should be more important"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...161,ISTJc,than people's sensitivities.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...162,ISTJc,"This is another one of
those questions where"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...163,ISTJc,"I would have been like
hard yes, and I'm not sure,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...164,ISTJc,'cause context matters so much.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...165,ISTJc,How much does the truth matter?
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...166,ISTJc,"That's the real question
to be answered here."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...167,ISTJc,"I think, once again, I'm
still on the side of agree,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...168,ISTJc,but it's not as hard of an agree anymore.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...169,ISTJc,I try to think about the context now.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...170,ISTJc,"Being able to develop
a plan and stick to it"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...171,ISTJc,"is the most important
part of every project."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...172,ISTJc,"I have to go back to that
adaptability question."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...173,ISTJc,"Dwight Eisenhower once said
that planning is everything,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...174,ISTJc,"but plans are nothing, and I
absolutely agree with that."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...175,ISTJc,"We often have to change
plans quickly and pivot."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...176,ISTJc,"I think that being able to
develop a plan is very important,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...177,ISTJc,"but the most important part
of every project, I think,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...178,ISTJc,is adaptability and communication.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...179,ISTJc,We'll go with disagree.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...180,ISTJc,"If someone does not respond
to your email quickly,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...181,ISTJc,"you start worrying if
you said something wrong."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...182,ISTJc,"Yes, I do, and I know this is irrational."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...183,ISTJc,"I know this is stupid,
because I have had people that"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...184,ISTJc,"I haven't responded to in
weeks, and it is no fault"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...185,ISTJc,of their own.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...186,ISTJc,"It's just my poor organization
or prioritizing other things,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...187,ISTJc,"and I tell myself that
every time I send an email,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...188,ISTJc,and I don't get a response quickly.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...189,ISTJc,"I tell myself, ""They're just busy""."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...190,ISTJc,"You know, they're probably
doing something else."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...191,ISTJc,"Their email's not a
priority, but there's always"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...192,ISTJc,"this little thing in the
back of my mind that's like,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...193,ISTJc,"""You probably said something wrong,"" or,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...194,ISTJc,"""You probably worded something,""
or, ""You put a period"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...195,ISTJc,"""on some sentence and
made it sound too terse""."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...196,ISTJc,"Yeah, we'll go with that."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...197,ISTJc,"You do not let other people
influence your actions."
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...198,ISTJc,"I feel like, if you
answer agree on this one,"
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...199,ISTJc,you're a little bit self-delusional.
ISTJc_My Personality Test Results...200,ISTJc,"I think we all have influences
even if they're subconscious."

INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ0,INFJc,hi everyone its Ren here I hope you're
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ1,INFJc,doing well in this video I would like to
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ2,INFJc,return to the question of MBC I and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ3,INFJc,particularly INF Janus there's this
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ4,INFJc,question and it's a question that tends
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ5,INFJc,to appear a lot in the conversations
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ6,INFJc,that people have by the NF J's sometimes
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ7,INFJc,it's themselves sometimes they're not
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ8,INFJc,sure whether it is what they are and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ9,INFJc,what I'm gonna talk about in this video
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ10,INFJc,is basically ways to figure out whether
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ11,INFJc,you are infj or not outside of the tests
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ12,INFJc,that are provided online you will hear
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ13,INFJc,that you know the tests are unreliable
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ14,INFJc,we all know that so I'm not going to
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ15,INFJc,cover this particular topic I'll just
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ16,INFJc,leave it aside as something that we have
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ17,INFJc,agreed upon if you get infj with an
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ18,INFJc,online test this does not mean that sure
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ19,INFJc,9f j just in the same way that if you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ20,INFJc,guess something else than infj in an
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ21,INFJc,online test this does not mean that you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ22,INFJc,are not infj so a lot of the time what
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ23,INFJc,you hear is that to figure out whether
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ24,INFJc,you are an infj you need to sort of you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ25,INFJc,need to look at the functions so this is
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ26,INFJc,obviously a recommendation that I would
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ27,INFJc,have for anyone who identifies as infj
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ28,INFJc,but is not particularly convinced or
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ29,INFJc,certain yes that they are nfj because I
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ30,INFJc,what I know is that INFJs tend to be
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ31,INFJc,among the people and let me know guys if
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ32,INFJc,you agree with this they tend to be
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ33,INFJc,among the people who are the most likely
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ34,INFJc,to keep questioning their type and they
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ35,INFJc,will not easily be satisfied that there
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ36,INFJc,are certain that they are this type okay
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ37,INFJc,and so maybe this could be a way for you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ38,INFJc,guys to just settle on it finally right
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ39,INFJc,because INFJs question all the time the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ40,INFJc,question all the time and this is a
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ41,INFJc,product of being an i and i dominant and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ42,INFJc,not using te i think but in any case you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ43,INFJc,want to study the functions sure but for
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ44,INFJc,the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ45,INFJc,you are either not familiar with the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ46,INFJc,functions and for those also that maybe
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ47,INFJc,are a little bit familiar with the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ48,INFJc,functions but they're not quite sure
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ49,INFJc,about how to go about them exactly what
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ50,INFJc,they mean right maybe I can give some
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ51,INFJc,tips or at least I can give you a
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ52,INFJc,perspective that for my part has really
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ53,INFJc,helped me to identify my type for sure
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ54,INFJc,okay
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ55,INFJc,so when you look at the function stack
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ56,INFJc,you know it's an IFV T is C interpreted
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ57,INFJc,intuition extraverted feeling
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ58,INFJc,introverted thinking and extroverted
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ59,INFJc,sensing so that's that that's the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ60,INFJc,archetype okay but you have to keep in
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ61,INFJc,mind that you have function tests online
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ62,INFJc,and you can take some of those functions
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ63,INFJc,tests but they will have the same
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ64,INFJc,problems they will they had the exact
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ65,INFJc,same issue that the other tests have so
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ66,INFJc,you can have certain tests that are more
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ67,INFJc,or less reliable about it Academy is you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ68,INFJc,can have certain functions tests that
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ69,INFJc,are reliable but the confirmation bias
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ70,INFJc,answering what you wish you were rather
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ71,INFJc,than what you really are answering
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ72,INFJc,what's your opinion about something
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ73,INFJc,rather than what you would really do
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ74,INFJc,yourself that's also going to crop up in
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ75,INFJc,the in the functions test so the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ76,INFJc,functions tests are useful but again not
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ77,INFJc,the ideal when you study your type and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ78,INFJc,you study the functions you want to look
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ79,INFJc,really carefully into the definition of
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ80,INFJc,introverted intuition and I I made
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ81,INFJc,videos on introverted intuition on my
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ82,INFJc,channel so if you just type search you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ83,INFJc,know for introverted intuition or if you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ84,INFJc,look just browse through my channel you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ85,INFJc,can check a video called introverted
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ86,INFJc,intuition in action I'll link it below
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ87,INFJc,in this in this video so that you can
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ88,INFJc,you can get a sense of how I relate to
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ89,INFJc,my own introverted intuition to see if
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ90,INFJc,you relate to it so research introverted
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ91,INFJc,intuition see if it feels familiar to
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ92,INFJc,you okay and the thing is I know for a
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ93,INFJc,fact that it's not easy to
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ94,INFJc,understand interpreting intuition it's a
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ95,INFJc,very abstract definition because by
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ96,INFJc,almost by nature introvert intuition is
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ97,INFJc,hard to talk about it's so abstract and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ98,INFJc,so symbolic and so nonverbal in many
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ99,INFJc,ways that once it gets translated into
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ100,INFJc,the verbal domain what you will read
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ101,INFJc,which which will be your resources
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ102,INFJc,sometimes will make it hard for you at
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ103,INFJc,first to distinguish say between ne and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ104,INFJc,ni right so perhaps you will have a
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ105,INFJc,difficulty distinguishing between ne and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ106,INFJc,ni I'm not going to go into the detail
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ107,INFJc,of the functions not but that's fine you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ108,INFJc,know but what's interesting is that if
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ109,INFJc,you hesitate in between any and ni at
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ110,INFJc,least you know that you're very high on
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ111,INFJc,n so you can you can cast aside the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ112,INFJc,sensor types right you're high on n so
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ113,INFJc,that's already something interesting
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ114,INFJc,because it might suggest that you're a
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ115,INFJc,dominant perceiver and if that suggests
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ116,INFJc,that your dominant perceiver you already
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ117,INFJc,sort of know that you're either a ntp en
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ118,INFJc,AF P int J or infj okay so that's that's
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ119,INFJc,like a very important thing to figure
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ120,INFJc,out you know focus on ni and even if you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ121,INFJc,struggle a bit to distinguish between an
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ122,INFJc,eye on an e see if you think n is the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ123,INFJc,most dominant function in your stack
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ124,INFJc,because in the difference between an and
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ125,INFJc,dominance and an auxilary is at least as
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ126,INFJc,important as the difference between a P
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ127,INFJc,and a J you know if not more it's
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ128,INFJc,probably more because at least the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ129,INFJc,difference is in terms of functions
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ130,INFJc,which are related back to Jung's theory
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ131,INFJc,whereas the P and J are related to how
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ132,INFJc,you manifest your extroverted functions
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ133,INFJc,which is I mean sure it has value but I
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ134,INFJc,think that the function stock is more
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ135,INFJc,interesting now the dominant function is
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ136,INFJc,very important because it really is what
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ137,INFJc,needs to be your like your main function
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ138,INFJc,that is you cannot be an infj
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ139,INFJc,if you're not an eye dominance you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ140,INFJc,cannot be an intp if you're not a TI
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ141,INFJc,dominance so that's why it's very
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ142,INFJc,important but
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ143,INFJc,this is important to figure out as well
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ144,INFJc,is that that does not mean that your
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ145,INFJc,function stack is going to be the exact
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ146,INFJc,same as the archetype right if you feel
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ147,INFJc,for example that you're a nine I
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ148,INFJc,dominance but I hear you're unusually
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ149,INFJc,high on Fi or on te or that UTI is not
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ150,INFJc,particularly high up and you think that
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ151,INFJc,your se is higher or if you feel like
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ152,INFJc,your fe could be higher that does not
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ153,INFJc,mean that you are not an infj okay if
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ154,INFJc,you felt that you were not strong on ni
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ155,INFJc,that would mean that you're not on a PG
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ156,INFJc,but if if if you are confident that you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ157,INFJc,are strong on ni the other functions
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ158,INFJc,they're not
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ159,INFJc,if you like they're not the the lens
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ160,INFJc,through which you see the world they're
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ161,INFJc,not the lens through which you see the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ162,INFJc,world so it's possible to repress to
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ163,INFJc,some extent Fe to have andhra develops
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ164,INFJc,TI to have slightly over develops SEI no
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ165,INFJc,infj is who online to have quite well
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ166,INFJc,developed se you know it's it's it's
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ167,INFJc,it's a it's a pattern if you like you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ168,INFJc,should never think in terms of I must
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ169,INFJc,fit the archetype it's a pattern so you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ170,INFJc,look at your function stack you analyze
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ171,INFJc,your different patterns of function use
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ172,INFJc,in wit and end this in the way in which
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ173,INFJc,you see it quality qualitatively if you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ174,INFJc,look at each function and you think okay
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ175,INFJc,I'll use this one I use that one you can
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ176,INFJc,take tests to sort of point you towards
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ177,INFJc,a resolution and then you compare the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ178,INFJc,pattern of your function use and you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ179,INFJc,look at the you know archetypes of the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ180,INFJc,of the MBTI types and you you match it
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ181,INFJc,against the one that looks like it the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ182,INFJc,most right so if you have a functional
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ183,INFJc,stack that looks the most like the infj
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ184,INFJc,means that you tend towards infj so you
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ185,INFJc,basically you can say I identify as an
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ186,INFJc,infj
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ187,INFJc,and you know is that this preserves the
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ188,INFJc,possibility for difference within INFJs
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ189,INFJc,and therefore this allows us to have an
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ190,INFJc,answer to people who argue that MBTI
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ191,INFJc,post people in box
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ192,INFJc,is because you you know if you reason in
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ193,INFJc,terms of attending towards a type having
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ194,INFJc,a function stack that matches best that
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ195,INFJc,particular function stack of that
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ196,INFJc,particular type then you know that
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ197,INFJc,actually makes room for diversity for an
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ198,INFJc,infinite amount of diversity so keep
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ199,INFJc,that in mind you know now in your in
INFJc_How to Be Certain That You Are INFJ200,INFJc,your for functions that you think you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer0,ESFJc,hi there in this video I want to talk
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer1,ESFJc,about a topic that has been coming up a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer2,ESFJc,lot recently a lot of my students have
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer3,ESFJc,asked me how do you break into the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer4,ESFJc,software development profession if you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer5,ESFJc,don't have a computer science degree
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer6,ESFJc,okay let's say your academia background
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer7,ESFJc,is in accounting or finance right or you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer8,ESFJc,graduated with a journalism degree or a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer9,ESFJc,history degree is it possible for a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer10,ESFJc,student with that educational background
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer11,ESFJc,to break into the software development
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer12,ESFJc,career and the answer is absolutely okay
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer13,ESFJc,just the number of jobs that are out
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer14,ESFJc,there is there exploding okay there's so
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer15,ESFJc,much demand and not enough supply so in
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer16,ESFJc,an environment like that it's certainly
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer17,ESFJc,possible as a matter of fact I'm a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer18,ESFJc,personal living example of someone that
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer19,ESFJc,does not have a computer science degree
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer20,ESFJc,but was able to acquire those skills
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer21,ESFJc,after graduation okay I graduated
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer22,ESFJc,college almost 15 years ago with an
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer23,ESFJc,accounting degree and with just three
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer24,ESFJc,months of self-study I got a software
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer25,ESFJc,development job and back then there were
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer26,ESFJc,plenty of jobs but now trust me there
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer27,ESFJc,are so many more jobs okay and so many
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer28,ESFJc,more opportunities so many different
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer29,ESFJc,areas to get into okay so I'm gonna
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer30,ESFJc,highlight some of this these things on
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer31,ESFJc,the whiteboard and hopefully give you a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer32,ESFJc,good understanding of the overall
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer33,ESFJc,landscape of IT and what you can do to
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer34,ESFJc,break into the software development
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer35,ESFJc,career okay
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer36,ESFJc,so let's get started in my opinion there
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer37,ESFJc,are three major areas in IT that you you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer38,ESFJc,can focus on okay one of these three
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer39,ESFJc,it's hard to focus on all three of these
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer40,ESFJc,areas at the same time but let's start
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer41,ESFJc,with the first elephant in the room the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer42,ESFJc,obvious path and that is a software
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer43,ESFJc,developer okay let's write that here
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer44,ESFJc,software dev and hopefully you can see
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer45,ESFJc,this I know there's a glare on the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer46,ESFJc,whiteboard so excuse me I just have some
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer47,ESFJc,overexposure from the light but this
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer48,ESFJc,software dev track in my opinion is a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer49,ESFJc,challenging track for someone that does
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer50,ESFJc,not have a computer science degree
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer51,ESFJc,because it requires you to know a couple
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer52,ESFJc,of different programming languages maybe
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer53,ESFJc,one or two the most popular ones are
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer54,ESFJc,Java and Python another very popular one
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer55,ESFJc,is PHP and then a candidate would also
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer56,ESFJc,need to have some understanding of the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer57,ESFJc,overall landscape of Technology
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer58,ESFJc,understand front-end understand back-end
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer59,ESFJc,so they need to know a little bit of
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer60,ESFJc,HTML CSS and some JavaScript and maybe a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer61,ESFJc,little bit of databases I'm just going
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer62,ESFJc,to draw a database here alright so the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer63,ESFJc,breadth of knowledge for this path is
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer64,ESFJc,pretty wide okay you'd need to know a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer65,ESFJc,lot of things so if you would like to
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer66,ESFJc,get into the software development path
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer67,ESFJc,but you're not a computer science major
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer68,ESFJc,I would recommend to start on a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer69,ESFJc,different path this could be your
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer70,ESFJc,eventual destination this could be your
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer71,ESFJc,goal this is what what happened to me
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer72,ESFJc,I started from a different area in
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer73,ESFJc,technology and then I transitioned but
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer74,ESFJc,into this area over time and you could
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer75,ESFJc,do the same thing and I've seen so many
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer76,ESFJc,people I've got so many examples of
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer77,ESFJc,people doing this back then as well as
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer78,ESFJc,right now okay so this is one path in my
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer79,ESFJc,opinion if you don't have a computer
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer80,ESFJc,science background it will take about
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer81,ESFJc,two years of hard work to learn this
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer82,ESFJc,stuff on your own and then hopefully be
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer83,ESFJc,in a position to land a job okay the the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer84,ESFJc,coding boot camps are great but you need
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer85,ESFJc,to have some prerequisite knowledge in
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer86,ESFJc,some of these areas if you want to avail
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer87,ESFJc,that knowledge okay so this takes time a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer88,ESFJc,better track for someone that doesn't
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer89,ESFJc,have a computer science degree in my
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer90,ESFJc,opinion is the database track and I'm
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer91,ESFJc,gonna write that down here database
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer92,ESFJc,because this is a focused area in
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer93,ESFJc,technology and data is key data is every
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer94,ESFJc,company's very it's it's one of the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer95,ESFJc,largest assets every company has very
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer96,ESFJc,important especially with what's going
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer97,ESFJc,on nowadays with Facebook data is key
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer98,ESFJc,it's huge and databases is where the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer99,ESFJc,data is stored so what you can do is
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer100,ESFJc,become a database expert in a language
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer101,ESFJc,called SQL sequel okay this language is
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer102,ESFJc,the primary language used to interact
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer103,ESFJc,with databases so you just need to learn
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer104,ESFJc,one language
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer105,ESFJc,and it's not even a programming language
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer106,ESFJc,so to speak it's actually a data
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer107,ESFJc,interaction language I've got two
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer108,ESFJc,courses on this on this topic so if you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer109,ESFJc,take both of those courses you should be
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer110,ESFJc,in pretty good shape with the sequel
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer111,ESFJc,language along with the sequel language
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer112,ESFJc,you can also learn a reporting tool such
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer113,ESFJc,as tableau and tableau nowadays is huge
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer114,ESFJc,there's so many job openings with
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer115,ESFJc,tableau and data analysis so with this
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer116,ESFJc,combination the sequel and tableau
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer117,ESFJc,combination you're employable how long
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer118,ESFJc,does this track take for someone that
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer119,ESFJc,can invest six hours a day every day for
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer120,ESFJc,about three months that's what that's
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer121,ESFJc,all that's required so three months I'd
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer122,ESFJc,say give two months for sequel and
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer123,ESFJc,invest six hours a day every day into
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer124,ESFJc,sequel master that technology and then
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer125,ESFJc,learn maybe for one month invest in
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer126,ESFJc,tableau and you've got it made you're
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer127,ESFJc,employable okay believe it or not a lot
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer128,ESFJc,of people are doing this you don't need
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer129,ESFJc,a computer science degree for this okay
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer130,ESFJc,so this in my opinion is the lowest
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer131,ESFJc,barrier of entry into the software
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer132,ESFJc,developer profession eventually once you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer133,ESFJc,once you're comfortable here
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer134,ESFJc,you can always transition to this field
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer135,ESFJc,a lot of people do this including myself
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer136,ESFJc,and so many people that I've seen I've
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer137,ESFJc,got so many examples okay so this could
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer138,ESFJc,be your eventual destination if you want
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer139,ESFJc,to build mobile apps websites you know
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer140,ESFJc,desktop applications you can you can
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer141,ESFJc,learn to do that on the weekends when
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer142,ESFJc,you're employed here okay don't graduate
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer143,ESFJc,college and sit for one year trying to
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer144,ESFJc,learn this stuff get your foot in the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer145,ESFJc,door after three months of practice get
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer146,ESFJc,your foot in the door in a in a database
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer147,ESFJc,and developer role because guess what
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer148,ESFJc,you're still a developer you could be
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer149,ESFJc,developing reports and using the sequel
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer150,ESFJc,language and then slowly transition into
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer151,ESFJc,this okay
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer152,ESFJc,so two paths so far the third path is
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer153,ESFJc,the admin path and this is also a great
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer154,ESFJc,you know lucrative field but in my
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer155,ESFJc,opinion it's for countries like India or
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer156,ESFJc,you know basically any country that is
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer157,ESFJc,not the United States or Canada the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer158,ESFJc,United States and Canada
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer159,ESFJc,outsource administrator jobs and the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer160,ESFJc,hottest topic within this domain is AWS
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer161,ESFJc,okay
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer162,ESFJc,AWS Amazon Web Services this is another
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer163,ESFJc,thing you could choose okay this will
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer164,ESFJc,take maybe a year to get really
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer165,ESFJc,comfortable with because there's a lot
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer166,ESFJc,of new development that's going on in
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer167,ESFJc,AWS and you should understand you should
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer168,ESFJc,have a certain breadth of knowledge and
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer169,ESFJc,that will take time to learn but it's a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer170,ESFJc,very lucrative career and you know
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer171,ESFJc,there's plenty of opportunities there in
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer172,ESFJc,my opinion if you're in the US this is
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer173,ESFJc,probably the fastest way to get your
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer174,ESFJc,foot in the door and probably the most
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer175,ESFJc,lucrative way okay as soon as you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer176,ESFJc,graduate college three months of hard
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer177,ESFJc,work in this area can land you a
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer178,ESFJc,well-paying job well over seventy eighty
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer179,ESFJc,thousand dollars and after two or three
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer180,ESFJc,years you can transition to either one
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer181,ESFJc,of these roles okay so with that being
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer182,ESFJc,said hopefully that was helpful if you
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer183,ESFJc,have any questions leave them in the
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer184,ESFJc,comments you can always email me at MTS
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer185,ESFJc,at job ready programmer com
ESFJc_Fastest way to become a software developer186,ESFJc,thanks for watching I'll see you soon
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student0,ESTJc,hey guys so welcome back to my channel
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student1,ESTJc,so today I want to talk about a topic
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student2,ESTJc,that I felt was very relevant to
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student3,ESTJc,probably a lot of my audience viewers
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student4,ESTJc,and something that I myself have gone
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student5,ESTJc,through personally in trouble with so
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student6,ESTJc,yeah today I'm gonna be talking about
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student7,ESTJc,how to get an internship so I now for a
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student8,ESTJc,lot of people getting into chip seems
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student9,ESTJc,like a really daunting task and
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student10,ESTJc,something that's really scary so today
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student11,ESTJc,I'm going to be talking about 10 steps
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student12,ESTJc,they essentially need to follow to help
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student13,ESTJc,you to get an engine so if you guys
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student14,ESTJc,would like to know what the processes of
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student15,ESTJc,getting an internship then please been
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student16,ESTJc,watching step one is to start early I
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student17,ESTJc,can't stress this enough it is so
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student18,ESTJc,important to start early because the
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student19,ESTJc,last thing you want to be doing is
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student20,ESTJc,scrambling and really trying to figure
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student21,ESTJc,out what you're gonna be doing during
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student22,ESTJc,the summer win the school year is
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student23,ESTJc,literally about to end yeah the last
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student24,ESTJc,thing you want to do is procrastinate on
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student25,ESTJc,something like this because it's so
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student26,ESTJc,important and then I think actually
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student27,ESTJc,might even take priority over school
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student28,ESTJc,it's just important to start early
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student29,ESTJc,because everyone else is going to be
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student30,ESTJc,competing for the same spots there are
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student31,ESTJc,only a certain number of spots available
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student32,ESTJc,so it's really important for you to
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student33,ESTJc,start over see if you at least get ahead
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student34,ESTJc,of the game typically fall time is when
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student35,ESTJc,the companies have their internship
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student36,ESTJc,programs and their internship
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student37,ESTJc,application out so depending on what
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student38,ESTJc,I've worked on track you want to go to
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student39,ESTJc,whether you want to image of your
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student40,ESTJc,business
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student41,ESTJc,chemistry computer science physics
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student42,ESTJc,biology etc you should really figure out

ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student98,ESTJc,that are on your resume are very
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student99,ESTJc,relevant number three polish your
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student100,ESTJc,LinkedIn so I'm not sure how many people
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student101,ESTJc,look online when they are going through
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student102,ESTJc,candidates but I know that companies do
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student103,ESTJc,look at your social media and I simply
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student104,ESTJc,did which is a professional network it's
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student105,ESTJc,a professional version of Facebook for
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student106,ESTJc,those of you don't know they did this
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student107,ESTJc,very important for you to polish you

ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student109,ESTJc,actually don't have that yet
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student110,ESTJc,but I need to get along doing that you
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student111,ESTJc,also want to make sure that you have all
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student112,ESTJc,of your most up-to-date clubs classes
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student113,ESTJc,that you take you whatever
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student114,ESTJc,accomplishments you've done if you build
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student115,ESTJc,anything if you've done other
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student116,ESTJc,internships before if you've done
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student117,ESTJc,research for anything put back on your
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student118,ESTJc,LinkedIn and I think it's very important
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student119,ESTJc,to update your LinkedIn because if you
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student120,ESTJc,are for example a freshman in college
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student121,ESTJc,it's okay to have things from high
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student122,ESTJc,school but as you progress through
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student123,ESTJc,college you really want to make sure
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student124,ESTJc,that all those things of high school are
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student125,ESTJc,kind of gone from your LinkedIn because
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student126,ESTJc,it's kind of irrelevant you know high
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student127,ESTJc,school you don't do much to prepare
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student128,ESTJc,yourself for the internship in the real
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student129,ESTJc,career world that's where so what you do
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student130,ESTJc,during college so I would say by the
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student131,ESTJc,time it's your sophomore year you really
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student132,ESTJc,shouldn't have anything from high school
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student133,ESTJc,on your resume or on your LinkedIn
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student134,ESTJc,because nobody cares and it's like a lot
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student135,ESTJc,of those times of what we've done in
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student136,ESTJc,high school is very intermediate level
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student137,ESTJc,and only when you start doing these in
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student138,ESTJc,college it's when those things are more
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student139,ESTJc,relevant to the workforce and more
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student140,ESTJc,relevant to the depth of knowledge that
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student141,ESTJc,you might experience in your potential
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student142,ESTJc,internship which is why putting your
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student143,ESTJc,most recent work on your LinkedIn is
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student144,ESTJc,very important and it is also really
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student145,ESTJc,important to make sure that everything
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student146,ESTJc,on your Linkedin is formatted nicely
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student147,ESTJc,up-to-date I think I'm not sure how
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student148,ESTJc,important is how people endorse your
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student149,ESTJc,skill personally I haven't gone around
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student150,ESTJc,asking people to do that so I guess it's
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student151,ESTJc,not that important but of course it's
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student152,ESTJc,nice to have it whatever way you can
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student153,ESTJc,help boost your LinkedIn social media
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student154,ESTJc,presence I think is really good and
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student155,ESTJc,really important number four figure out
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student156,ESTJc,what kind of companies that you want to
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student157,ESTJc,apply to and I say this because you
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student158,ESTJc,don't want to apply to things without
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student159,ESTJc,even knowing where you want applying to
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student160,ESTJc,I think he should in general have a idea
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student161,ESTJc,of what you're open to I understand that
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student162,ESTJc,when you're first starting out as my
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student163,ESTJc,profession or sophomore you're applying
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student164,ESTJc,for an internship maybe you are open to
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student165,ESTJc,let all different sized companies you
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student166,ESTJc,know your own and you are okay with
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student167,ESTJc,starting small size companies mid-sized
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student168,ESTJc,companies or corporate enterprises
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student169,ESTJc,you're okay with all of those and that
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student170,ESTJc,is okay and that's fine I think that as
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student171,ESTJc,you apply to more more internships as
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student172,ESTJc,the progress of the years you should
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student173,ESTJc,really hone down on what size and what
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student174,ESTJc,kind of company that you want to work
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student175,ESTJc,for number five figure out location so
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student176,ESTJc,for a lot of people you know myself
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student177,ESTJc,included I would never want to work
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student178,ESTJc,anywhere in the middle in the middle of
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student179,ESTJc,the United States for example you don't
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student180,ESTJc,want to be on the far west class or even
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student181,ESTJc,want to give a far east coast and even
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student182,ESTJc,if from the parties because I'm not too
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student183,ESTJc,keen on working somewhere like North
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student184,ESTJc,Carolina South Carolina Florida
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student185,ESTJc,Connecticut New Hampshire look I'm not
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student186,ESTJc,too keen on working in those states and
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student187,ESTJc,nothing in the middle of the u.s.
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student188,ESTJc,nothing against those places it's just
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student189,ESTJc,that it's too far from where what I've
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student190,ESTJc,grown up with and yes well it's a good
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student191,ESTJc,idea to get out of your comfort zone I
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student192,ESTJc,don't want to be so far out of my
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student193,ESTJc,comfort zone that I feel uncomfortable
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student194,ESTJc,and I'm not happy with where I am over
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student195,ESTJc,the summer so I think make sure that you
ESTJc_How to Get an Internship | Advice from a UC Berkeley Student196,ESTJc,apply to internships that are in

INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!47,INFJc,will go on to YouTube pages Facebook
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!48,INFJc,reddit all kinds of things while they're
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!49,INFJc,anonymous or they show their name
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!50,INFJc,they're going to troll and they're going
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!51,INFJc,to start discussions and they really
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!52,INFJc,want to start discussions not because
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!53,INFJc,they want to fight even though they do
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!54,INFJc,find fighting interesting or debating
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!55,INFJc,interesting they just love the fun of it
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!56,INFJc,it's not it it's not that they really
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!57,INFJc,want to hurt people they just want to
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!58,INFJc,kind of stir up the pot and that's what
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!59,INFJc,I think about when I think of an teepees
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!60,INFJc,they're very innovative creative people
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!61,INFJc,and they're gonna find new ways to stir
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!62,INFJc,up the pot they're gonna throw fuel to
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!63,INFJc,the fire wherever they can just to see
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!64,INFJc,what the reaction is whereas like a te
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!65,INFJc,user again let's say an ENTJ or an INTJ
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!66,INFJc,they're gonna be more concerned with
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!67,INFJc,okay so she'll if I put fuel on this
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!68,INFJc,fire then this is what's going to happen
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!69,INFJc,like this is the fact but with an
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!70,INFJc,teepees they're more experimental with
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!71,INFJc,it they're they have they value
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!72,INFJc,introverted thinking that's where their
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!73,INFJc,creative creativity stirs from so
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!74,INFJc,they're going to
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!75,INFJc,be very experimental in that and even
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!76,INFJc,though maybe there might be one reaction
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!77,INFJc,or there might be let's say a fact
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!78,INFJc,associated with what happens when you
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!79,INFJc,throw fuel to the fire
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!80,INFJc,so to speak they're gonna find other
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!81,INFJc,ways to manipulate that and see if they
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!82,INFJc,can try and find different things
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!83,INFJc,different reactions from that same thing
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!84,INFJc,but in a different way and you're gonna
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!85,INFJc,find because they're interested in so
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!86,INFJc,many things and they just want to know
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!87,INFJc,so much about everything they're gonna
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!88,INFJc,seem flighty and a similar way as like
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!89,INFJc,say an ENFP but it's different like I
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!90,INFJc,said about the ENFP enfps have
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!91,INFJc,introverted feeling as their secondary
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!92,INFJc,function even though they both tepees
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!93,INFJc,and enfps both lead with expert
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!94,INFJc,intuition they're going to NFP s are
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!95,INFJc,going to be more concerned with how that
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!96,INFJc,new perspective or new situation or new
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!97,INFJc,person new feeling it's gonna be more
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!98,INFJc,based in emotions and feelings and
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!99,INFJc,things like that where an INTP they do
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!100,INFJc,it as like very they're very inquisitive
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!101,INFJc,and they want to just pull things out
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!102,INFJc,and turn them over and make people see
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!103,INFJc,things in a different way whether they
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!104,INFJc,whether they like it or not whereas an
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!105,INFJc,ENFP is very they can hone in on
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!106,INFJc,individuals emotions with introverted
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!107,INFJc,feeling so if they're in a group an ENFP
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!108,INFJc,is most likely the more considerate out
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!109,INFJc,of the ENFP and the ntp at least
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!110,INFJc,seemingly ant appease you know they
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!111,INFJc,don't really value introverted feeling
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!112,INFJc,introverted feeling at least in
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!113,INFJc,myers-briggs is not in their stock it's
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!114,INFJc,definitely in socionics and if you want
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!115,INFJc,to think about like shadow functions
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!116,INFJc,stuff like that
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!117,INFJc,introverted feeling is something that
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!118,INFJc,entities do not value they don't really
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!119,INFJc,care how an individual feels but they're
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!120,INFJc,very good at persuading people and this
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!121,INFJc,is this is obviously not directed on an
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!122,INFJc,individual emotional level even though
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!123,INFJc,they can still be that way it's directed
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!124,INFJc,because so let's say someone was doing
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!125,INFJc,something that was wrong and it may not
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!126,INFJc,even just be morally wrong but a lot of
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!127,INFJc,times it is or factually wrong whatever
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!128,INFJc,it is the NDP instead of like the ENFP
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!129,INFJc,the ENFP may you know try to persuade
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!130,INFJc,that person in a different way or like
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!131,INFJc,you know really listen to that person
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!132,INFJc,individually and kind of really
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!133,INFJc,associate with that person's emotions
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!134,INFJc,and even though they may be blunt in
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!135,INFJc,some ways they're not going to come off
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!136,INFJc,as shrewd or as you know blunt as like
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!137,INFJc,an intp Antibes have like a bad rep for
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!138,INFJc,being like these talkers or like
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!139,INFJc,again they're the debaters they like to
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!140,INFJc,be argumentative that's like a
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!141,INFJc,stereotype but really they just want
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!142,INFJc,people to realize what the truth is
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!143,INFJc,and what the facts actually are like not
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!144,INFJc,just the facts but what basically news
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!145,INFJc,t.i logic to persuade them in such a way
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!146,INFJc,that they completely change their
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!147,INFJc,perspective enterpise are all about
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!148,INFJc,changing perspectives and if they're not
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!149,INFJc,able to change their perspective or they
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!150,INFJc,feel like they are like jaw like I guess
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!151,INFJc,pulled down in some way where they're
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!152,INFJc,kind of told oh this is what you have to
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!153,INFJc,do and that's a they're kind of put in
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!154,INFJc,this box they're not going to want to be
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!155,INFJc,in that box and they're gonna find a way
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!156,INFJc,to get out of that box
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!157,INFJc,whatever way possible and really it
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!158,INFJc,means whatever way they will literally
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!159,INFJc,find whatever way they're not going to
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!160,INFJc,stay there
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!161,INFJc,um so moving on to actually feeling as I
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!162,INFJc,was saying earlier with extraverted
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!163,INFJc,feeling an teepees are very good at
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!164,INFJc,persuading people that's different than
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!165,INFJc,say an Effie Dom actually feeling person
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!166,INFJc,that leads with extra feeling either
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!167,INFJc,primary or secondary function especially
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!168,INFJc,enfjs their first function is
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!169,INFJc,extraverted feeling iya enough j's are
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!170,INFJc,known for being like these very
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!171,INFJc,persuasive people think of someone like
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!172,INFJc,oprah winfrey and even some people say
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!173,INFJc,like Nelson Mandela even though I've
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!174,INFJc,also heard infj for Nelson Mandela and
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!175,INFJc,I've also heard MLK as being ENFJ but
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!176,INFJc,I've also heard infj so either way they
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!177,INFJc,have extra feeling as their first or
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!178,INFJc,second function so those people are
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!179,INFJc,persuasive in a different way than say
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!180,INFJc,the INTP again the NTP doesn't really
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!181,INFJc,care how an individual feels whereas
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!182,INFJc,someone that leads with extra feeling or
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!183,INFJc,their secondary function is extra
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!184,INFJc,feeling there's auxiliary function
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!185,INFJc,they're going to be a lot more concerned
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!186,INFJc,even though they may not value the
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!187,INFJc,individual emotions and they may not be
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!188,INFJc,able to us easily tap into their own
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!189,INFJc,emotions they're going to really care
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!190,INFJc,and pick up on those emotions and that's
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!191,INFJc,not to say that an tepees can't do that
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!192,INFJc,or they don't care about that they
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!193,INFJc,certainly do and that's another
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!194,INFJc,stereotype is that
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!195,INFJc,intps are basically like these cold
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!196,INFJc,emotional people in a different way than
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!197,INFJc,say an INTJ an teepees again are like
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!198,INFJc,extroverted but they are very they can
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!199,INFJc,come off as crude and all and a bit
INFJc_Why I Love ENTPs!!!!!200,INFJc,abrasive sometimes for certain people
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google0,ISTP,what's up everybody how's it go and just
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google1,ISTP,want to do a quick introduction here
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google2,ISTP,basically in this video I wanted to
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google3,ISTP,share with you the story of how I went
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google4,ISTP,from quite literally never having
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google5,ISTP,written a line of code in my life to
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google6,ISTP,landing a job as a software engineer at
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google7,ISTP,Google in just a little over six months
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google8,ISTP,and as you'll see in this video I really
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google9,ISTP,tried to be candid and transparent
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google10,ISTP,because I want to give you sort of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google11,ISTP,accurate information I want to paint a
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google12,ISTP,real picture of what happened without
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google13,ISTP,leaving out important details but at the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google14,ISTP,same time without sort of adding a bunch
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google15,ISTP,of useless information and hopefully
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google16,ISTP,this video will be just that me telling
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google17,ISTP,you what I did during these six months
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google18,ISTP,so with that I hope that this video will
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google19,ISTP,be insightful maybe even inspirational
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google20,ISTP,or at the very least
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google21,ISTP,interesting and enjoy so I graduated
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google22,ISTP,from college in May of 2016 with a major
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google23,ISTP,in math in college I had been sort of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google24,ISTP,all over the place I was gonna major in
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google25,ISTP,visual studies at one point then I was
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google26,ISTP,gonna major in economics then
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google27,ISTP,mathematical economics and I ended up in
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google28,ISTP,math but the point is that when I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google29,ISTP,graduated from college I had never
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google30,ISTP,written a single line of code in my life
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google31,ISTP,and that was largely due to two reasons
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google32,ISTP,the first one is that I had this really
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google33,ISTP,bad misconception that if who hadn't
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google34,ISTP,been studying coding since you were a
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google35,ISTP,kid or since high school you couldn't do
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google36,ISTP,it in college couldn't do computer
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google37,ISTP,science in college it really annoys me
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google38,ISTP,thinking back that I had this
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google39,ISTP,misconception but I did have it the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google40,ISTP,second reason is that I didn't like it I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google41,ISTP,had seen other people do some coding and
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google42,ISTP,I was just kind of turned off by it and
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google43,ISTP,I had dabbled in HTML and CSS for one
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google44,ISTP,weekend in college by the way I realized
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google45,ISTP,that some of you here gonna thank oh but
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google46,ISTP,you said you never wrote the line of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google47,ISTP,code in your life HTML and CSS you know
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google48,ISTP,learning the fundamentals of HTML and
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google49,ISTP,CSS is not quite the same thing as you
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google50,ISTP,know learning how to write Python or
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google51,ISTP,JavaScript or C++ I bet that someone in
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google52,ISTP,the comments here is gonna be like you
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google53,ISTP,you said that you never wrote a single
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google54,ISTP,line of code in your life and yet you
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google55,ISTP,wrote HTML and CSS you get the ideas and
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google56,ISTP,I just didn't like it I did not like the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google57,ISTP,the very little amount of HTML CSS I'd
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google58,ISTP,done during that one weekend and so I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google59,ISTP,just had never picked it up very quickly
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google60,ISTP,after I graduated from college I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google61,ISTP,realized that a lot of the things that I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google62,ISTP,wanted to do launch my own business or
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google63,ISTP,work in product management and venture
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google64,ISTP,capital all these things required coding
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google65,ISTP,skills and I just discovered what coding
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google66,ISTP,boot camps were so I decided you know
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google67,ISTP,what I'm gonna apply to a coding boot
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google68,ISTP,camp and I'm gonna learn how to code and
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google69,ISTP,that is really the sort of start of my
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google70,ISTP,software engineering journey or my
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google71,ISTP,journey to software engineering that's
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google72,ISTP,when it started in early June of 2016
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google73,ISTP,a few weeks after I'd graduated from
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google74,ISTP,college when I started applying to these
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google75,ISTP,coding boot camps I applied to for
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google76,ISTP,coding boot camps and I wrote my very
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google77,ISTP,first real line of code while applying
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google78,ISTP,to them the way that these coding boot
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google79,ISTP,camps work is that they don't want their
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google80,ISTP,students to arrive on the first day of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google81,ISTP,in-person classes or online classes
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google82,ISTP,having never written a single line of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google83,ISTP,code in their lives they want them at
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google84,ISTP,that point in time to be at a sort of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google85,ISTP,very elementary level of coding
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google86,ISTP,knowledge but they want them to be able
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google87,ISTP,to understand basic code so in order not
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google88,ISTP,to sort of discriminate against people
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google89,ISTP,like me who have never written a line of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google90,ISTP,code in their lives or who had never
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google91,ISTP,written a line of code in their lives
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google92,ISTP,they give you preparatory material when
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google93,ISTP,you apply you know you can check off the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google94,ISTP,box that says I've never written a line
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google95,ISTP,of code in my life and they send you
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google96,ISTP,material very basic material to teach
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google97,ISTP,you the sort of fundamentals of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google98,ISTP,programming and so I remember I applied
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google99,ISTP,to these coding boot camps in you know
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google100,ISTP,early June of 2016 about a few weeks
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google101,ISTP,after I graduated from college and I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google102,ISTP,started learning how to code from these
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google103,ISTP,sort of you know online articles that
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google104,ISTP,they sent me I learned about conditional
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google105,ISTP,statements you know if else I learned
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google106,ISTP,about loops and you know very basic
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google107,ISTP,recursion I remember
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google108,ISTP,recursion was sort of like you know
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google109,ISTP,advanced topic and that's when I wrote
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google110,ISTP,my very first line of code now to get
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google111,ISTP,into these coding boot camps you have to
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google112,ISTP,pass an interview brightly's back then
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google113,ISTP,when I was applying I had to pass an

ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google131,ISTP,very into them that was probably what
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google132,ISTP,sort of pulled me into coding at the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google133,ISTP,very beginning I really liked I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google134,ISTP,immediately fell in love with these sort
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google135,ISTP,of coding interview questions I remember
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google136,ISTP,loving to do the palindrome question or

ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google139,ISTP,given at the time as a practice problem
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google140,ISTP,and I just found it very enjoyable very
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google141,ISTP,fun and so during you know the first few
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google142,ISTP,weeks of June 2016 I found myself doing
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google143,ISTP,a lot of these sort of you know easy

ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google153,ISTP,September to mid-december and then there
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google154,ISTP,was gonna be one month before the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google155,ISTP,program started in August that would
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google156,ISTP,just be sort of self directed at home
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google157,ISTP,with some you know tutorials and things
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google158,ISTP,they would send me and so I remember I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google159,ISTP,spent the month of July 2016 to sort of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google160,ISTP,very excited that I'd gotten into the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google161,ISTP,program and kind of you know going back
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google162,ISTP,to playing video games all day I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google163,ISTP,remember I didn't
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google164,ISTP,any coding during that month then the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google165,ISTP,month of August rolled around and I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google166,ISTP,started doing their sort of pre work
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google167,ISTP,online and during that time I wasn't
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google168,ISTP,doing anything too crazy
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google169,ISTP,I was following what they were doing it
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google170,ISTP,was you know just a few hours of coding
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google171,ISTP,per day I wouldn't say that I was doing
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google172,ISTP,anything particularly more than that in
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google173,ISTP,large part because they were sort of
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google174,ISTP,warning you telling you do what we're
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google175,ISTP,giving you not much more you'll have
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google176,ISTP,plenty of coding to do during the three
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google177,ISTP,months of the immersive part of the
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google178,ISTP,program so I sort of just took them by
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google179,ISTP,out by their word and did just that
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google180,ISTP,then the immersive part of the coding
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google181,ISTP,boot camp started it went from September
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google182,ISTP,2016 all the way to December 2016 or
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google183,ISTP,mid-december and those three months and
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google184,ISTP,a half were really the highlight of my
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google185,ISTP,journey to software engineering during
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google186,ISTP,those three months I was living and
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google187,ISTP,breathing coding and most of my peers
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google188,ISTP,most of the people in the coding boot
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google189,ISTP,camp with me were doing the same thing
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google190,ISTP,or similar things but I was really I
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google191,ISTP,really treated that as all I'm gonna do
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google192,ISTP,during those three months and a half is
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google193,ISTP,coding and coding related stuff because
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google194,ISTP,it's really important for to understand
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google195,ISTP,that this was a big this was sort of a
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google196,ISTP,it wasn't too risky but it was it was a
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google197,ISTP,big thing to have done this coding boot
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google198,ISTP,camp I say it wasn't that risky because
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google199,ISTP,you know I just graduated from college
ISTP_How I Learned to Code in 6 Months - And Got Into Google200,ISTP,but it was still a big big thing it cost

ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control0,ESTP,hey I just wanted to talk about this
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control1,ESTP,this inherent problem in Christianity
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control2,ESTP,that exists because it's it's pretty
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control3,ESTP,counterproductive to what they want to
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control4,ESTP,do at least genetically anyways if you
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control5,ESTP,had a crop you'd want to take the best
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control6,ESTP,of the crop and and every next crop
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control7,ESTP,you'd want to keep using the best seats
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control8,ESTP,the seeds from the best plant
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control9,ESTP,Christianity sort of doing the opposite
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control10,ESTP,and they're going to pretty much destroy
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control11,ESTP,their gene pool by doing this a this and
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control12,ESTP,basically they're trying to preach
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control13,ESTP,chastity and restraint from sexual
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control14,ESTP,sexual drives and such but what they're
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control15,ESTP,doing is they're taking their most
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control16,ESTP,chaste their most sexually pure right
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control17,ESTP,the ones that have the most self
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control18,ESTP,restraint and they're putting them in
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control19,ESTP,the clergy and they can't pass on their
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control20,ESTP,seed they can't have kids so what's the
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control21,ESTP,gene pool left with right and this has
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control22,ESTP,been happening for thousands of years
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control23,ESTP,now two thousand years almost what do
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control24,ESTP,you think happens you take all of your
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control25,ESTP,most sexually pure and the next clergy
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control26,ESTP,has to come from whoever can't can't be
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control27,ESTP,in the clergy right and so what you're
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control28,ESTP,going to end up doing is you're going to
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control29,ESTP,end up demoralizing your your gene pool
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control30,ESTP,you're going to take people that are
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control31,ESTP,have very strong sexual urges and that's
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control32,ESTP,going to be the basis of your gene pool
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control33,ESTP,and you're going to take these people
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control34,ESTP,with strong sexual urges throw them into
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control35,ESTP,the clergy and say hey don't have sex
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control36,ESTP,and here are these people in the clergy
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control37,ESTP,with very strong sexual urges and they
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control38,ESTP,can't have no way to release it and so
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control39,ESTP,what's going to happen well we've
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control40,ESTP,already started seeing it molesting
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control41,ESTP,children and I don't know it's nice nuts
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control42,ESTP,no it's not really intelligent to base a
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control43,ESTP,your your law structure around degrading
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control44,ESTP,your gene pool away from your values I
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control45,ESTP,mean
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control46,ESTP,if you wanted to do something in the
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control47,ESTP,opposite direction it might be better to
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control48,ESTP,uphold your values i mean take force the
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control49,ESTP,clergy members to have children and the
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control50,ESTP,ones that are the most holy and able to
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control51,ESTP,have sexual straight force them and then
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control52,ESTP,all the ones who can't restrain
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control53,ESTP,themselves make them have abortions I
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control54,ESTP,mean that's the most which you're not
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control55,ESTP,allowing them to do so I mean I wouldn't
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control56,ESTP,be surprised about this this over over
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control57,ESTP,sexual gene pool that that you're trying
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control58,ESTP,"to create here I mean this is only 2,000"
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control59,ESTP,years if you want your your religion to
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control60,ESTP,stay for another two thousand ten
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control61,ESTP,thousand years how long are you going to
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control62,ESTP,try to keep it around so what's your
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control63,ESTP,gene pool getting up like I mean you're
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control64,ESTP,just going to keep degrading it and
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control65,ESTP,degrading it until you just fall apart
ESTP_Christianity's genetic destruction of sexual control66,ESTP,so something to think about

ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice89,ESTJc,brother and I never like remembered
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice90,ESTJc,having anxiety as a kid but I have
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice91,ESTJc,watched videos like from when I was
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice92,ESTJc,younger and I was very very quiet and
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice93,ESTJc,shy and very soft-spoken as a kid
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice94,ESTJc,especially like when my brother came
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice95,ESTJc,just because you know when there's a
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice96,ESTJc,baby in the family like everyone's kind
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice97,ESTJc,of attracted to the baby so when someone
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice98,ESTJc,was like giving me attention I was kind
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice99,ESTJc,of like standoffish I guess are like shy
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice100,ESTJc,because I wasn't really used to it um so
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice101,ESTJc,maybe that is kind of where a lot of it
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice102,ESTJc,stemmed from I don't know but that's
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice103,ESTJc,just something that I personally noticed
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice104,ESTJc,I never had anxiety like through
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice105,ESTJc,elementary school if you guys are
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice106,ESTJc,subscribers of mine you guys know that I
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice107,ESTJc,talked to a therapist now um and we kind
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice108,ESTJc,of pinpointed I guess some issues that
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice109,ESTJc,have come up in terms of my middle
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice110,ESTJc,school experience that I wasn't aware of
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice111,ESTJc,which is another great thing about
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice112,ESTJc,therapy is like you'll find certain
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice113,ESTJc,things about what triggers you or why
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice114,ESTJc,you have a specific problem that you
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice115,ESTJc,were never aware of to begin with um so
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice116,ESTJc,it's really interesting in that sense
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice117,ESTJc,because I was like bullied in middle
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice118,ESTJc,school bullied I mean like I think
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice119,ESTJc,everyone kind of was picked on I just
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice120,ESTJc,had a specific person that I was like
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice121,ESTJc,friends with but really they weren't
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice122,ESTJc,really my friend they were like I don't
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice123,ESTJc,know I mean I think they were my friend
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice124,ESTJc,but like they were like mean you know
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice125,ESTJc,and I'm not gonna dive too deep into
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice126,ESTJc,that but basically um the way that she
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice127,ESTJc,had treated me kind of paved the way of
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice128,ESTJc,like why I'm afraid to be myself around
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice129,ESTJc,people why I kind of build up a wall why
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice130,ESTJc,I'm kind of quiet and reserved because
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice131,ESTJc,when
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice132,ESTJc,I wasn't or when I was myself I was
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice133,ESTJc,ridiculed judged and completely bullied
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice134,ESTJc,for it so that's something that I kind
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice135,ESTJc,of came to the realization of like why I
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice136,ESTJc,am a certain way around especially like
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice137,ESTJc,new people I didn't know that as a kid
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice138,ESTJc,that like I had just recently kind of
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice139,ESTJc,had an aha moment with that I have a lot
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice140,ESTJc,of anxiety in terms of like being around
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice141,ESTJc,people I don't know if it's social
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice142,ESTJc,anxiety because when I'm around people
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice143,ESTJc,that I like love them that I know I
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice144,ESTJc,really am NOT anxious at all it's
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice145,ESTJc,usually around like huge crowd of people
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice146,ESTJc,that I don't particularly know and I'm
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice147,ESTJc,kind of in a closed-off space like if
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice148,ESTJc,it's out and this is really weird but
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice149,ESTJc,like if it's out in the open I'm totally
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice150,ESTJc,fine but like if it's like in a very
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice151,ESTJc,very closed space like where I can't
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice152,ESTJc,exit the room like I get a little bit
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice153,ESTJc,anxious actually a lot of bit anxious
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice154,ESTJc,and it's just something I've dealt with
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice155,ESTJc,my whole life I don't know like I just
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice156,ESTJc,so even as a kid like I was I don't know
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice157,ESTJc,I just don't like being around a lot of
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice158,ESTJc,people especially people that are super
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice159,ESTJc,like have big personalities I tend to
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice160,ESTJc,kind of get like even worse shy or like
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice161,ESTJc,worse in my little bubble and looking
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice162,ESTJc,back into like my middle school time
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice163,ESTJc,it's kind of like the reason why I'm
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice164,ESTJc,like that is because I'm afraid of being
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice165,ESTJc,judged and I'm afraid of like people
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice166,ESTJc,picking on me or I'm afraid of someone
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice167,ESTJc,you know calling me out or something so
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice168,ESTJc,for me something else that I noticed
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice169,ESTJc,about my anxiety is that I'm really good
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice170,ESTJc,in terms of like starting fresh like if
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice171,ESTJc,I have a new start where I don't know
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice172,ESTJc,anybody or I feel like it's a new start

ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice174,ESTJc,like being totally okay like that's when
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice175,ESTJc,my anxiety like goes down is like when
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice176,ESTJc,I'm kind of in a new space so for
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice177,ESTJc,example when I went to high school I was
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice178,ESTJc,like in such a good mood I was talking
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice179,ESTJc,to tons of people because it was a new

ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice182,ESTJc,be and I could be myself without you
ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice183,ESTJc,know hiding that and so when I went into

ESTJc_Living with Social Anxiety | my story & advice185,ESTJc,school I never like really wore my hair

ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift139,ESTJc,cafeteria and I always like to sit
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift140,ESTJc,outside sitting
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift141,ESTJc,outside just you know it's a breath of
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift142,ESTJc,fresh air and a nice break feels like
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift143,ESTJc,you're actually taking a break and
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift144,ESTJc,stepping away from the hospital but
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift145,ESTJc,here's some pasta hummus and meatballs
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift146,ESTJc,was actually pretty good now that I've
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift147,ESTJc,successfully food coma myself it is now
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift148,ESTJc,time to head back upstairs and go back
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift149,ESTJc,to work
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift150,ESTJc,I'm honestly shook it's because I was
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift151,ESTJc,not expecting this
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift152,ESTJc,but this is literally the first time
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift153,ESTJc,this has happened to me in the one year
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift154,ESTJc,that I worked here okay this is actually
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift155,ESTJc,crazy it is currently I think like 3
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift156,ESTJc,p.m. it's 3:30 p.m. and I am back home I
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift157,ESTJc,have literally never ever ever been sent
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift158,ESTJc,home early and of course the one day
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift159,ESTJc,that I decide to vlog a day my life is
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift160,ESTJc,the one day that I get sent home early
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift161,ESTJc,but it actually it happened I feel like
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift162,ESTJc,decently often just has never happened
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift163,ESTJc,to me but in the ICU essentially what
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift164,ESTJc,happens is during the day oftentimes
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift165,ESTJc,patients are transferred out and if you
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift166,ESTJc,have two patients that are hot up that
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift167,ESTJc,two different nurses had then the two
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift168,ESTJc,patients will be combined and one nurse
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift169,ESTJc,will take the full assignment while the
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift170,ESTJc,other nurse is sent home so I was a
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift171,ESTJc,nurse who was sent home and it is
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift172,ESTJc,actually a Sunday afternoon so I'll take
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift173,ESTJc,it I don't mind but I am back tomorrow
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift174,ESTJc,and I won't have that assignment back
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift175,ESTJc,which is kind of a bummer but I guess
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift176,ESTJc,it's not too bad all of a sudden I have
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift177,ESTJc,an extra what all of a sudden I have an
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift178,ESTJc,extra like six hours to my day so this
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift179,ESTJc,will be nice okay I'm gonna do the
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift180,ESTJc,honors and take some oil blotting sheets
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift181,ESTJc,and just show you in 8 hours exactly
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift182,ESTJc,what accumulates on my face like I can
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift183,ESTJc,literally feel it and I usually bring
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift184,ESTJc,these to work with me because it gets
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift185,ESTJc,crazy and when I have a moment I just
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift186,ESTJc,tried to you know refresh
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift187,ESTJc,not Gail oh my goodness very easily
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift188,ESTJc,grossed out don't watch this here's what
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift189,ESTJc,they look like pretty crazy
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift190,ESTJc,it's a lot of oil on my skin so if
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift191,ESTJc,you're wondering why break out after you
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift192,ESTJc,work it's because there's so much oil
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift193,ESTJc,that collects on your skin and of course
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift194,ESTJc,naturally I hopped in the shower so that
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift195,ESTJc,I can cleanse myself after this long
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift196,ESTJc,shift
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift197,ESTJc,okay guys update time I take a shower I
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift198,ESTJc,always do after shift you make your
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift199,ESTJc,payments on an isolationist feel like
ESTJc_Day in the life of a nurse | 12 Hour shift200,ESTJc,being in the hospital but as usual I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude0,INFPc,okay this is actually my third time
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude1,INFPc,recording this video because I just feel
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude2,INFPc,so awkward it's been so long since I've
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude3,INFPc,made a video the act of sitting alone in
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude4,INFPc,a room and just talking to an inanimate
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude5,INFPc,object and hearing yourself talk is very
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude6,INFPc,weird it's very unnatural to all the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude7,INFPc,other youtubers out there I really
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude8,INFPc,admire you you're taking good job oh my
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude9,INFPc,gosh I haven't like self-praise there
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude10,INFPc,but no really like some people can talk
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude11,INFPc,to a camera so naturally and I feel like
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude12,INFPc,maybe I'm not one of those people until
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude13,INFPc,I really really warm up so maybe the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude14,INFPc,last two videos are just me warming up
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude15,INFPc,anyway welcome back to my channel I'm
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude16,INFPc,really glad you guys are sticking with
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude17,INFPc,me oh my gosh and to all those people
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude18,INFPc,who commented on my previous video I'm
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude19,INFPc,so thankful I read all the comments and
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude20,INFPc,even some of the people's comments that
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude21,INFPc,were a little bit harsh I still like to
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude22,INFPc,thank you because well II took time out
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude23,INFPc,of your day you watched my video you
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude24,INFPc,heard my side of the story and you took
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude25,INFPc,time out of your day to comment so I'm
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude26,INFPc,really grateful for that and all the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude27,INFPc,other comments oh my gosh you guys have
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude28,INFPc,such great things to say some people
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude29,INFPc,offered perspectives that I have never
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude30,INFPc,really thought about people are relating
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude31,INFPc,and I guess I just feel like I'm not
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude32,INFPc,alone it sounds kind of silly but I felt
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude33,INFPc,kind of unique in this experience I was
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude34,INFPc,honestly thinking like okay even if
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude35,INFPc,people get divorced there's a divorce
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude36,INFPc,proceeding you can't just well I guess
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude37,INFPc,some people disappear but generally you
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude38,INFPc,have to state your reasons for wanting
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude39,INFPc,to get the word like if you've been
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude40,INFPc,married for a decade or whatever so I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude41,INFPc,was feeling kind of alone but I guess
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude42,INFPc,that was obviously naive of me people
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude43,INFPc,have gone through similar experiences
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude44,INFPc,and more difficult experiences so for
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude45,INFPc,everyone who shared your experience a
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude46,INFPc,big thank you to back because ya just
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude47,INFPc,made me feel like not alone oh that's so
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude48,INFPc,odd because usually I feel like I don't
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude49,INFPc,really mind feeling alone I usually want
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude50,INFPc,to feel like I'm alone
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude51,INFPc,I'm unique and no one understands my
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude52,INFPc,pain like I don't know if other infps
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude53,INFPc,relate to this but it's kind of maybe
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude54,INFPc,enough I think maybe in India ground for
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude55,INFPc,thing anyway the comments helped me a
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude56,INFPc,lot now let's go to the name change
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude57,INFPc,you have good suggestions but then I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude58,INFPc,just decided to name it how I wanted to
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude59,INFPc,name my channel okay so the main
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude60,INFPc,suggestions or something to do with the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude61,INFPc,theme of coffee so Insp coffee and BTI
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude62,INFPc,coffee
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude63,INFPc,Insp cafe and VTI cafe they were all
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude64,INFPc,really good someone mention Apokolips
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude65,INFPc,a-- like the apocalypse but with my name
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude66,INFPc,ha ha very funny
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude67,INFPc,yeah there were really good name
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude68,INFPc,suggestions but in the end i decided to
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude69,INFPc,go with casual cognition I just really
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude70,INFPc,like that name and I'll explain why I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude71,INFPc,think it fits later but you know the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude72,INFPc,thing about coffee naming it that would
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude73,INFPc,be smart to keep like the continuity of
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude74,INFPc,previous channel name into current
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude75,INFPc,channel name but I just have a different
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude76,INFPc,set of associations so that now so like
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude77,INFPc,quick lesson I guess on how si works I'm
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude78,INFPc,sure it's something previously I had all
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude79,INFPc,these positive associations with coffee
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude80,INFPc,like self-care time intellectual
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude81,INFPc,conversation casual hang out with
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude82,INFPc,friends time even like the sod of an
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude83,INFPc,acquaintanceship becoming a friendship
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude84,INFPc,so I had all these like introverted
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude85,INFPc,sensing associations to coffee but then
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude86,INFPc,like when I quit coffee because of the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude87,INFPc,negative effects that it had on my body
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude88,INFPc,you know that's not to say that caffeine
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude89,INFPc,has the same effect on everyone but like
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude90,INFPc,I'm their nose to me I was having all
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude91,INFPc,these negative effects caused by coffee
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude92,INFPc,that I didn't know about until I quit so
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude93,INFPc,after I could I have all these negative
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude94,INFPc,associations like stress and anxiety and
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude95,INFPc,to be honest I have the association to
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude96,INFPc,my old channel I guess the channel that
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude97,INFPc,I used to run with Alex and I guess I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude98,INFPc,just want to get as far away from that
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude99,INFPc,as I can mentally emotionally speaking
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude100,INFPc,content speaking it's gonna be like
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude101,INFPc,similar it's gonna be like on part but
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude102,INFPc,yeah just like
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude103,INFPc,mentally I want to detach myself from
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude104,INFPc,all of that and I thought that casual
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude105,INFPc,cognition was a great name because
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude106,INFPc,obviously this channel has always been a
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude107,INFPc,little bit casual and I think that's
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude108,INFPc,what people liked about it it's it was
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude109,INFPc,never two presenters who are experts
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude110,INFPc,being like let me tell you everything
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude111,INFPc,about kind of functions it was always
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude112,INFPc,like oh we're just having a conversation
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude113,INFPc,and we might discover some things
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude114,INFPc,together and you can tell me your
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude115,INFPc,feedback and you know over time I've
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude116,INFPc,become more formal but I think my motto
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude117,INFPc,has always been Big Ideas small words
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude118,INFPc,and that I want to convey the most
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude119,INFPc,complex of things in a way that's
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude120,INFPc,understandable to everyone I want to use
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude121,INFPc,examples that are relatable and
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude122,INFPc,understandable to Emily want to do
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude123,INFPc,explain like I'm five if you follow that
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude124,INFPc,subreddit I just don't see any point in
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude125,INFPc,being pretentious or using all these
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude126,INFPc,like complex or too complex metaphors
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude127,INFPc,when the simple ones will do just fine
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude128,INFPc,like I want to make this relatable to
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude129,INFPc,everyone so that hopefully more people
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude130,INFPc,in the world will catch on that hate
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude131,INFPc,kind of fictions I kind of types they're
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude132,INFPc,important and they're helpful to my life
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude133,INFPc,and I'm gonna apply them and type my
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude134,INFPc,friends and everything and besides that
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude135,INFPc,I still want to do those more casual
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude136,INFPc,videos that are just for fun
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude137,INFPc,I'll look for an example my video like
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude138,INFPc,10 sample I enough piece so I'm still
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude139,INFPc,gonna do that but I also wanted to do
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude140,INFPc,things like to sample fictional iana
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude141,INFPc,piece yeah like I wanted to talk about
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude142,INFPc,the kind of types of fictional
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude143,INFPc,characters obviously that's not a very
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude144,INFPc,serious endeavor because it's not really
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude145,INFPc,provable well not that the kind of types
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude146,INFPc,of real people are currently provable
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude147,INFPc,either but it's like I'm on a more
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude148,INFPc,happy-go-lucky fun kind of thing and I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude149,INFPc,might do some more skits if I enjoy
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude150,INFPc,doing those like even though it's very
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude151,INFPc,stereotypical you guys seem to enjoy it
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude152,INFPc,too so yeah I might do all sorts of like
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude153,INFPc,fun little things to keep myself happy
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude154,INFPc,keep myself entertained because if I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude155,INFPc,just present everyday I don't think I'll
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude156,INFPc,keep up with this channel I think I'll
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude157,INFPc,just burn out yeah and I also like to do
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude158,INFPc,life streaming yeah I want to do so many
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude159,INFPc,different things so I think by keeping
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude160,INFPc,casual on the name I can do all those
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude161,INFPc,things and I can explain everything in a
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude162,INFPc,casual but effective and relatable
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude163,INFPc,manner hopefully and the part about
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude164,INFPc,cognition obviously that comes from the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude165,INFPc,kind of functions but cognition is also
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude166,INFPc,a universal mental process and I really
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude167,INFPc,wanted to put that in the name because I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude168,INFPc,wanted to expand a little bit
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude169,INFPc,someone has recommended or requested
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude170,INFPc,that I do a topic video on codependency
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude171,INFPc,and narcissism that's a very important
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude172,INFPc,psychological topic that I like to cover
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude173,INFPc,but I feel like if it's just
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude174,INFPc,Insp coffee there's not really and in
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude175,INFPc,for me to do that but if it's casual
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude176,INFPc,cognition I feel like it's the full
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude177,INFPc,realm of psychology and here to talk
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude178,INFPc,about whatever I want I can talk about
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude179,INFPc,like self esteem self development
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude180,INFPc,psychological disorders like narcissism
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude181,INFPc,and codependency attachment styles love
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude182,INFPc,languages like I can talk about all of
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude183,INFPc,these things that I'm very passionate
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude184,INFPc,about and I think are very helpful to
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude185,INFPc,people by the way a lot of people who
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude186,INFPc,after I typed them they're like okay so
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude187,INFPc,now that I know I'm an INTP or whatever
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude188,INFPc,how can I improve my life or how can I
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude189,INFPc,use that knowledge to fix my loss low
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude190,INFPc,confidence fix my procrastination I'm
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude191,INFPc,just like you can't have like you can't
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude192,INFPc,fix all of these universal problems by
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude193,INFPc,knowing your kind of type like you can
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude194,INFPc,help yourself so much by knowing your
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude195,INFPc,kind of type of you can't make the
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude196,INFPc,universal issues like procrastination or
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude197,INFPc,a low self-esteem it's a universal issue
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude198,INFPc,not because everyone has low self-esteem
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude199,INFPc,but because any type can develop low
INFPc_Name Change and Gratitude200,INFPc,self-esteem and has nothing to do with

of the word ""very"" to describe everything,"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!22,ESFJc,"and use other words which give more information,
which will make you sound more like a native"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!23,ESFJc,"speaker and make your
writing phenomenal."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!24,ESFJc,"Oh, ""phenomenal""?"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!25,ESFJc,"That's a word for ""very good""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!26,ESFJc,Are you ready?
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!27,ESFJc,Let's go to the board.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!28,ESFJc,"So, today's lesson is on ""very""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!29,ESFJc,"""Very"" is a very good word, that's why we use
it, but when you're writing, to hear somebody"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!30,ESFJc,"say: ""Very, very, very, very, very, very,
very, very"" is what we call monotonous, it"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!31,ESFJc,"means ""mono"" as one, ""tonous"", one
tone, one sound - very boring."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!32,ESFJc,"So let's change that
from you being..."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!33,ESFJc,"You know, using ""very"" because I teach and
I notice a lot of students saying things,"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!34,ESFJc,"like: ""Teacher, today
it's very cold outside."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!35,ESFJc,"I'm like: -""Yeah, it is."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!36,ESFJc,"-""And I'm very tired
and very hungry."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!37,ESFJc,"I'm like: ""Okay, okay."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!38,ESFJc,"It's like being punched in the face again and
again, and I just want to say: ""Stop with"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!39,ESFJc,the 'very'.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!40,ESFJc,"Use a different word."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!41,ESFJc,"But it's not fair because ""very"" is a very
good word-there, I did it again-we just need"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!42,ESFJc,"to find other words to make your language
sound richer to improve it so you sound more"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!43,ESFJc,"like a native English speaker, and to make
it more interesting for you because it will"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!44,ESFJc,"express more of who you are and
your ideas in a better way."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!45,ESFJc,It makes you unique.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!46,ESFJc,You ready?
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!47,ESFJc,Let's go to the board.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!48,ESFJc,"You'll notice I put ""very"" in red because
this is something we don't want to do, we"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!49,ESFJc,"don't want to keep
saying: ""very""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!50,ESFJc,We want to change that up.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!51,ESFJc,"And I'm going to give you a list of words
that people or students usually say when they"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!52,ESFJc,"say ""very"" that I've
heard many, many times."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!53,ESFJc,And maybe you've done this.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!54,ESFJc,"And today I'm going to give you
singular words to use instead."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!55,ESFJc,"I'll explain them, just in
case they're difficult."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!56,ESFJc,Let's start with the first one.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!57,ESFJc,"People say: ""Very rude"", instead of
saying that, you can say: ""vulgar""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!58,ESFJc,"""Vulgar"" means very rude, and if somebody
says to me: ""Your language is vulgar"", I'll"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!59,ESFJc,"probably stop talking because it means it's
not right, it's inappropriate, it's very bad."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!60,ESFJc,Vulgar.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!61,ESFJc,"""I don't like your vulgar
tone"", your rude tone."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!62,ESFJc,It's strong.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!63,ESFJc,"""Very short"", another word we say
is ""brief"", which means small."

a very short conversation."

ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!67,ESFJc,"""Boring""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!68,ESFJc,"When you say: ""Class was very
boring today"", you can say: ""dull""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!69,ESFJc,"""Dull"" means very boring."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!70,ESFJc,"It also means...
See?"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!71,ESFJc,"Here's a bonus when you
use these words, stupid."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!72,ESFJc,"If you say someone is dull, you can say they're
very boring, or dull meaning they're stupid."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!73,ESFJc,"Don't use it like that too often;
people don't like being called stupid."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!74,ESFJc,"And if you say: ""He's
rather dull, isn't he?"""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!75,ESFJc,"I have to listen for context
to mean stupid or boring."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!76,ESFJc,"Next one, everybody's
favourite: ""Very good""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!77,ESFJc,"""Teacher, the food is very good."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!78,ESFJc,The lesson is very good.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!79,ESFJc,"I like this, it's very good."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!80,ESFJc,"Why don't we change that
to the word ""superb""?"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!81,ESFJc,"Look carefully at the word ""superb"", you
have the word ""super"" written inside it."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!82,ESFJc,"""Super"" means what?"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!83,ESFJc,"Above average, excellent,
or superb, very good."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!84,ESFJc,"""The food was superb."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!85,ESFJc,"People don't usually use this word, so if
you tell me when I cook for you that it's"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!86,ESFJc,"superb, I'm telling you right now I will
take that as such an amazing compliment."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!87,ESFJc,"Gentlemen, if you tell a woman she looks
superb, she'll be like: ""Thank you."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!88,ESFJc,"Really?"""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!89,ESFJc,Because no one says it.
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!90,ESFJc,All right?
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!91,ESFJc,"""Freezing"", you can say: ""It's very cold
outside"", but in minus 35, it's freezing."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!92,ESFJc,"I can put meat outside and it will turn to
ice, it's freezing, that's how cold it is."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!93,ESFJc,"And if you tell me it's freezing, I'm going
to get a jacket and another coat, and a hat,"
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!94,ESFJc,"and a scarf because I know
it's very, very cold."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!95,ESFJc,"You don't have to say: ""It's
very, very cold today."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!96,ESFJc,"Say: ""It's freezing."""
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!97,ESFJc,"Next, here's a nice word, this
is what we call a $10 word."

there's: ""Arr, arr""."

ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!131,ESFJc,"They moved quickly or you say they moved
at a rapid pace, very quickly, very fast."

you can use the word: ""rapid"" or ""rapidly""."
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!133,ESFJc,Right?
ESFJc_Improve your Vocabulary: Stop saying VERY!134,ESFJc,Adverb.

ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity45,ISTPc,"I saw Chinese people struggling terribly 
to learn English and other languages,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity46,ISTPc,and so my question got refined down to:
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity47,ISTPc,How can you help a normal adult
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity48,ISTPc,"learn a new language 
quickly, easily and effectively?"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity49,ISTPc,"Now this is a really, really important 
question in today's world."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity50,ISTPc,"We have massive challenges 
with environment,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity51,ISTPc,"we have massive challenges 
with social dislocation,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity52,ISTPc,"with wars, all sorts of things going on"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity53,ISTPc,"and if we can't communicate,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity54,ISTPc,"we're really going to have difficulty 
solving these problems."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity55,ISTPc,"So we need to be able to speak 
each other's languages,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity56,ISTPc,"this is really, really important."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity57,ISTPc,The question then is: How do you do that?
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity58,ISTPc,"Well, it's actually really easy."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity59,ISTPc,"You look around for people 
who can already do it,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity60,ISTPc,"you look for situations 
where it's already working"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity61,ISTPc,"and then you identify the principles
and apply them."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity62,ISTPc,"It's called modelling and I've been 
looking at language learning"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity63,ISTPc,"and modelling language learning 
for about 15 to 20 years now."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity64,ISTPc,"And my conclusion, 
my observation from this is"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity65,ISTPc,"that any adult can learn a second 
language to fluency inside six months."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity66,ISTPc,"Now when I say this, most people 
think I'm crazy, this is not possible."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity67,ISTPc,"So let me remind everybody of 
the history of human progress,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity68,ISTPc,it's all about expanding our limits.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity69,ISTPc,"In 1950, everybody believed that running 
one mile in four minutes was impossible,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity70,ISTPc,and then Roger Bannister did it in 1956
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity71,ISTPc,"and from there 
it's got shorter and shorter."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity72,ISTPc,"100 years ago everybody believed that 
heavy stuff doesn't fly."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity73,ISTPc,Except it does and we all know this.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity74,ISTPc,How does heavy stuff fly?
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity75,ISTPc,"We reorganise the material 
using principles that we have learned"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity76,ISTPc,"from observing nature, birds in this case."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity77,ISTPc,And today we've gone even further...
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity78,ISTPc,"We've gone even further, 
so you can fly a car."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity79,ISTPc,"You can buy one of these 
for a couple 100.000 US dollars."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity80,ISTPc,We now have cars in the world that fly.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity81,ISTPc,"And there's a different way to fly 
which we've learned from squirrels."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity82,ISTPc,"So all you need to do is copy 
what a flying squirrel does,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity83,ISTPc,"build a suit called a wing suit and 
off you go, you can fly like a squirrel."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity84,ISTPc,"Now most people, a lot of people, 
I wouldn't say everybody"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity85,ISTPc,but a lot of people think they can't draw.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity86,ISTPc,"However there are some key principles, 
five principles, that you can apply"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity87,ISTPc,"to learning to draw and you can 
actually learn to draw in five days."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity88,ISTPc,"So, if you draw like this, you learn 
these principles for five days"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity89,ISTPc,"and apply them and after five days 
you can draw something like this."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity90,ISTPc,"Now I know this is true because 
that was my first drawing"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity91,ISTPc,"and after five days of applying these 
principles that was what I was able to do."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity92,ISTPc,And I looked at this and I went:
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity93,ISTPc,"""Wow, so that's how I look like 
when I'm concentrating so intensely"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity94,ISTPc,"that my brain is exploding."""
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity95,ISTPc,"So, anybody can learn to draw in five days"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity96,ISTPc,"and in the same way, with the same logic,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity97,ISTPc,"anybody can learn a second language
in six months."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity98,ISTPc,"How? There are five principles
and seven actions."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity99,ISTPc,"There may be a few more 
but these are absolutely core."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity100,ISTPc,"And before I get into those 
I just want to talk about two myths,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity101,ISTPc,I want to dispel two myths.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity102,ISTPc,The first is that you need talent.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity103,ISTPc,Let me tell you about Zoe.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity104,ISTPc,"Zoe came from Australia, went to Holland, 
was trying to learn Dutch,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity105,ISTPc,"struggling extremely, extremely... 
a great deal"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity106,ISTPc,"and finally people were saying: 
""You're completely useless,"""
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity107,ISTPc,"""you're not talented,"" ""give up,"" 
""you're a waste of time"""
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity108,ISTPc,"and she was very, very depressed."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity109,ISTPc,"And then she came across 
these five principles,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity110,ISTPc,she moved to Brazil and she applied them
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity111,ISTPc,"and in six months 
she was fluent in Portuguese,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity112,ISTPc,so talent doesn't matter.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity113,ISTPc,"People also think that immersion in a new 
country is the way to learn a language."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity114,ISTPc,"But look around Hong Kong, 
look at all the westerners"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity115,ISTPc,"who've been here for 10 years, 
who don't speak a word of Chinese."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity116,ISTPc,"Look at all the Chinese living in 
America, Britain, Australia, Canada"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity117,ISTPc,"have been there 10, 20 years 
and they don't speak any English."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity118,ISTPc,Immersion per se does not work.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity119,ISTPc,"Why? Because a drowning man 
cannot learn to swim."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity120,ISTPc,"When you don't speak a language, 
you're like a baby."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity121,ISTPc,And if you drop yourself into a context
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity122,ISTPc,"which is all adults talking about stuff 
over your head, you won't learn."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity123,ISTPc,"So, what are the five principles 
that you need to pay attention to?"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity124,ISTPc,"First: the four words,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity125,ISTPc,"attention, meaning, relevance and memory,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity126,ISTPc,"and these interconnect in very, 
very important ways."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity127,ISTPc,"Especially when you're talking 
about learning."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity128,ISTPc,"Come with me on a journey 
through a forest."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity129,ISTPc,You go on a walk through a forest
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity130,ISTPc,"and you see something like this... 
Little marks on a tree,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity131,ISTPc,"maybe you pay attention, maybe you don't."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity132,ISTPc,"You go another 50 metres 
and you see this..."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity133,ISTPc,You should be paying attention.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity134,ISTPc,"Another 50 metres, if you haven't been 
paying attention, you see this..."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity135,ISTPc,"And at this point,
you're paying attention."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity136,ISTPc,"And you've just learned that this...
is important,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity137,ISTPc,"it's relevant 
because it means this,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity138,ISTPc,"and anything that is related, 
any information related to your survival"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity139,ISTPc,"is stuff that you're going to pay
attention to"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity140,ISTPc,"and therefore you're going
to remember it."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity141,ISTPc,"If it's related to your personal goals,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity142,ISTPc,then you're going to pay attention to it.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity143,ISTPc,"If it's relevant, 
you're going to remember it."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity144,ISTPc,"So, the first rule, 
first principle for learning a language"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity145,ISTPc,"is focus on language content 
that is relevant to you."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity146,ISTPc,Which brings us to tools.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity147,ISTPc,"We master tools by using tools 
and we learn tools the fastest"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity148,ISTPc,when they are relevant to us.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity149,ISTPc,So let me share a story.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity150,ISTPc,A keyboard is a tool.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity151,ISTPc,"Typing Chinese a certain way, 
there are methods for this. That's a tool."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity152,ISTPc,I had a colleague many years ago
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity153,ISTPc,"who went to night school; 
Tuesday night, Thursday night,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity154,ISTPc,"two hours each time, practicing at home,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity155,ISTPc,"she spent nine months, 
and she did not learn to type Chinese."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity156,ISTPc,And one night we had a crisis.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity157,ISTPc,"We had 48 hours to deliver 
a training manual in Chinese."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity158,ISTPc,"And she got the job, 
and I can guarantee you"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity159,ISTPc,"in 48 hours, she learned to type Chinese"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity160,ISTPc,"because it was relevant,
it was meaningful, it was important,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity161,ISTPc,she was using a tool to create value.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity162,ISTPc,"So the second principle for learning 
a language is to use your language"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity163,ISTPc,"as a tool to communicate 
right from day one."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity164,ISTPc,As a kid does.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity165,ISTPc,"When I first arrived in China, 
I didn't speak a word of Chinese,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity166,ISTPc,"and on my second week, 
I got to take a train ride overnight."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity167,ISTPc,"I spent eight hours sitting 
in the dining car"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity168,ISTPc,"talking to one of the guards on the train,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity169,ISTPc,"he took an interest in me for some reason,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity170,ISTPc,and we just chatted all night in Chinese
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity171,ISTPc,"and he was drawing pictures and 
making movements with his hands"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity172,ISTPc,"and facial expressions 
and piece by piece by piece"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity173,ISTPc,I understood more and more.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity174,ISTPc,"But what was really cool, 
was two weeks later,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity175,ISTPc,"when people were talking Chinese 
around me,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity176,ISTPc,I was understanding some of this
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity177,ISTPc,"and I hadn't even made any effort 
to learn that."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity178,ISTPc,"What had happened, 
I'd absorbed it that night on the train,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity179,ISTPc,which brings us to the third principle.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity180,ISTPc,"When you first understand the message,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity181,ISTPc,"then you will acquire 
the language unconsciously."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity182,ISTPc,"And this is really, 
really well documented now,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity183,ISTPc,"it's something called 
comprehensible input."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity184,ISTPc,"There's 20 or 30 years 
of research on this,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity185,ISTPc,"Stephen Krashen, a leader in the field,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity186,ISTPc,"has published all sorts of 
these different studies"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity187,ISTPc,and this is just from one of them.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity188,ISTPc,"The purple bars show the scores 
on different tests for language."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity189,ISTPc,"The purple people were people who had 
learned by grammar and formal study,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity190,ISTPc,"the green ones are the ones 
who learned by comprehensible input."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity191,ISTPc,"So, comprehension works. 
Comprehension is key"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity192,ISTPc,"and language learning is not about 
accumulating lots of knowledge."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity193,ISTPc,"In many, many ways 
it's about physiological training."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity194,ISTPc,"A woman I know from Taiwan 
did great in English at school,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity195,ISTPc,"she got A grades all the way through,"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity196,ISTPc,"went through college, A grades, 
went to the US"
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity197,ISTPc,"and found she couldn't understand 
what people were saying."
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity198,ISTPc,"And people started asking her: 
""Are you deaf?"""
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity199,ISTPc,And she was. English deaf.
ISTPc_How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale | TEDxLingnanUniversity200,ISTPc,"Because we have filters 
in our brain that filter in"
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies0,ISTP,hello so I am a nice teepee and I just
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies1,ISTP,wanted to make a video about my hobbies
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies2,ISTP,because they're a big part of my life
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies3,ISTP,and there's really important to me so
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies4,ISTP,I've noticed that there's not a lot of
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies5,ISTP,content out there about is teepees and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies6,ISTP,most of it is actually geared towards
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies7,ISTP,male is teepees so I thought it would
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies8,ISTP,just be helpful for everyone to have an
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies9,ISTP,example of what a female eyes to be
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies10,ISTP,enjoys doing so I want to share this
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies11,ISTP,because I think that the more data
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies12,ISTP,that's out there on is teepees the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies13,ISTP,easier will be for people to set aside
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies14,ISTP,some of these really surface level
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies15,ISTP,stereotypes and begin to really
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies16,ISTP,understand the mindset that really
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies17,ISTP,drives the ice teepee so obviously I'm
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies18,ISTP,only sharing my experience I don't know
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies19,ISTP,that everything that drives me is
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies20,ISTP,universal among is teepees but the best
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies21,ISTP,I can do is share my perspective and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies22,ISTP,hope that there's other ice teepees out
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies23,ISTP,there or anyone else has any insights to
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies24,ISTP,add so that my experiences can be
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies25,ISTP,compared with yours and we can come to a
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies26,ISTP,better understanding of who I stays
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies27,ISTP,really are so before I start I first
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies28,ISTP,wanted to say that there's a lot of
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies29,ISTP,stuff out there about ICPs being
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies30,ISTP,daredevils and really into like high
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies31,ISTP,adrenaline risky activities and sports
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies32,ISTP,and that is not a tallboy I'm actually a
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies33,ISTP,super safe person but I'm not really
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies34,ISTP,gonna get into that right now because
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies35,ISTP,that could be a whole other video and so
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies36,ISTP,I'm just gonna gloss over that but just
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies37,ISTP,know that I'm kind of setting that aside
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies38,ISTP,right now I'm just gonna focus on the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies39,ISTP,things that I do enjoy doing so all of
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies40,ISTP,the hobbies that I have or at least most
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies41,ISTP,of the hobbies that I have are very
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies42,ISTP,driven by infrared thinking and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies43,ISTP,extroverted sensing and kind of those
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies44,ISTP,both working together so I say X Rho
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies45,ISTP,says he is the most immediately obvious
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies46,ISTP,because what I like to do is usually
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies47,ISTP,hands-on where expert sensing is less
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies48,ISTP,obvious is how it helps me observe
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies49,ISTP,what's in front of me um then I take
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies50,ISTP,those observations the data I gather
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies51,ISTP,from that and I use my interpretive
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies52,ISTP,thinking to really analyze and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies53,ISTP,understand what's in front of me like
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies54,ISTP,what how it works what it's made of and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies55,ISTP,how it could be improved or changed so
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies56,ISTP,if I were to describe myself overall I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies57,ISTP,would say that I'm very in tune with the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies58,ISTP,nuance in the physical realm by that I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies59,ISTP,mean like flavor the way things smell
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies60,ISTP,the way things feel the way they look I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies61,ISTP,just have heightened awareness of the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies62,ISTP,nuance and that in turn enables me to be
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies63,ISTP,a very precise person I would say I'm
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies64,ISTP,also very creative more and I like a
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies65,ISTP,practical like hands-on like
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies66,ISTP,down-to-earth kind of way not if you're
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies67,ISTP,an abstract way and somewhat artistic
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies68,ISTP,and I have a natural aptitude for
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies69,ISTP,learning new hands-on skills there's
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies70,ISTP,also a lot of things I enjoy take an
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies71,ISTP,interesting that are heavily and we're
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies72,ISTP,thinking based and even introverted
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies73,ISTP,intuition um but because things that
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies74,ISTP,involve expert sense you know I would
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies75,ISTP,say are really the things I love the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies76,ISTP,most
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies77,ISTP,I'm just going to focus on those hobbies
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies78,ISTP,so let's see I would say the first one
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies79,ISTP,I'm going to start with because it's
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies80,ISTP,something I enjoy doing for like my
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies81,ISTP,whole life that I'm still really into is
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies82,ISTP,baking now to clarify I don't want to
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies83,ISTP,lose any kind of baking I like more
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies84,ISTP,creative baking so I don't really enjoy
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies85,ISTP,following recipes I find them to be very
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies86,ISTP,boring and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies87,ISTP,my plane um I I don't know let's see
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies88,ISTP,well why do I like being I guess I love
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies89,ISTP,just like combining the ingredients and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies90,ISTP,kind of just using using my analytical
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies91,ISTP,skills and applying it to baking like I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies92,ISTP,know what different ingredients to an
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies93,ISTP,extent I know how old fact when I'm
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies94,ISTP,making until I imagine the outcome that
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies95,ISTP,is like desirable and then I start
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies96,ISTP,figuring out what I could do to try to
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies97,ISTP,achieve that outcome
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies98,ISTP,and I also really like mastering like
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies99,ISTP,the feel of the batter like the way it
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies100,ISTP,looks in the oven in the second it's
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies101,ISTP,supposed to come out the way the way it
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies102,ISTP,feels like when you touch in the oven um
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies103,ISTP,different flavors the combinations the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies104,ISTP,amounts of each like spice the texture
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies105,ISTP,that I'm trying to achieve all that kind
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies106,ISTP,of stuff I don't know I could just I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies107,ISTP,love to just know it by like the way it
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies108,ISTP,smells what it feels and be able to just
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies109,ISTP,achieve the best outcome and so for a
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies110,ISTP,long time I really just would experiment
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies111,ISTP,and I would just create recipes or
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies112,ISTP,variations of recipes I've kind of just
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies113,ISTP,severe from what was written but then I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies114,ISTP,would never write it down so I could
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies115,ISTP,never recreate it in like a year ago or
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies116,ISTP,so someone told me no you should really
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies117,ISTP,write this things down so that if you
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies118,ISTP,like it you can make it again or you can
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies119,ISTP,improve it the next time and that was a
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies120,ISTP,really great interesting it's not
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies121,ISTP,something I'm naturally prone to I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies122,ISTP,normally don't really like writing
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies123,ISTP,things down I like to just kind of roll
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies124,ISTP,with it and see what happens but doing
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies125,ISTP,that has been so good and so helpful and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies126,ISTP,it's been really fun because it allows
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies127,ISTP,me to not just like experiment something
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies128,ISTP,new but I can actually like do
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies129,ISTP,iterations I can see what went wrong and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies130,ISTP,see what I can do better
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies131,ISTP,and so that's kind of a fun challenge um
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies132,ISTP,so I have like a million things I like
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies133,ISTP,to do not a lot of things I've mastered
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies134,ISTP,as a but I've taken since like are
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies135,ISTP,joining College I've taken quite a few
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies136,ISTP,classes to like community college or
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies137,ISTP,just in the community in general so the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies138,ISTP,first class that I took upon graduating
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies139,ISTP,was welding which is actually really
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies140,ISTP,cool also physically exhausting so but I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies141,ISTP,think that's part of the reason why I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies142,ISTP,don't continue with it as much also I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies143,ISTP,don't have the equipment so it's kind of
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies144,ISTP,hard to do but for those of you who've
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies145,ISTP,never welded before it was very
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies146,ISTP,interesting thing to experience the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies147,ISTP,first time because they just kind of
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies148,ISTP,show you briefly how to do it and they
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies149,ISTP,throw you into this stall and just you
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies150,ISTP,just have at it which just seems really
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies151,ISTP,dangerous you know but it's okay so the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies152,ISTP,first time I did it you like you know
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies153,ISTP,this stick right and you gotta like
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies154,ISTP,strike the arc just right and then and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies155,ISTP,then you got to kind of like it slowly
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies156,ISTP,gets eaten up as you're going down and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies157,ISTP,you okay so you create the puddle and
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies158,ISTP,you pull it but the first time I did it
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies159,ISTP,so I strike the arc and then personally
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies160,ISTP,you can't see anything cuz you're in
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies161,ISTP,this mask and it's completely black so
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies162,ISTP,you're blind while you're striking the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies163,ISTP,arc on this metal piece in front of you
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies164,ISTP,um and then suddenly like sparks are
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies165,ISTP,flying at you it's really loud it's
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies166,ISTP,really hot in there sparks flying
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies167,ISTP,directly in your face
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies168,ISTP,I'm just very alarming when you've never
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies169,ISTP,done anything like that before but then
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies170,ISTP,once I like stop and just accepted the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies171,ISTP,fact that there is it was gonna be like
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies172,ISTP,this crazy work environment then once I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies173,ISTP,accepted that I was able to just like
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies174,ISTP,allow with a spark light at me allowed
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies175,ISTP,this everything coming at me and just
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies176,ISTP,focus in and zero in
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies177,ISTP,in front of me and just like watch the
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies178,ISTP,puddle until we pull it and like focus
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies179,ISTP,on how things felt and what I was seeing
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies180,ISTP,and it just ignore everything else
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies181,ISTP,around me which was a very incredible
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies182,ISTP,experience like I would leave and I'm
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies183,ISTP,just a dream not literally dream but
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies184,ISTP,like I would just daydream about it
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies185,ISTP,because it's really cool so I like that
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies186,ISTP,I think is just a really cool skill to
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies187,ISTP,learn using I don't know material but I
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies188,ISTP,never really built with before and it's
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies189,ISTP,useful so I like that um let's see
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies190,ISTP,another class I took was archery I think
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies191,ISTP,I've always had kind of a fascination
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies192,ISTP,with more like guys stuff cuz I don't
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies193,ISTP,actually know what arteries from but not
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies194,ISTP,as technologically advanced things so
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies195,ISTP,like it's something that someone could
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies196,ISTP,literally make and build themselves
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies197,ISTP,obviously in this archery class I was
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies198,ISTP,not easy to homey oh I was but I still
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies199,ISTP,really liked it I really like target
ISTP_ISTP Female | Hobbies200,ISTP,practice and just focusing on everything

ENFJ_Out with the old.0,ENFJ,I came on to social media as Sorella I'm
ENFJ_Out with the old.1,ENFJ,all about three and a half years ago and
ENFJ_Out with the old.2,ENFJ,the journey has been amazing I have
ENFJ_Out with the old.3,ENFJ,enjoyed every single part of it up until
ENFJ_Out with the old.4,ENFJ,the beginning of this year when
ENFJ_Out with the old.5,ENFJ,everything just changed I started
ENFJ_Out with the old.6,ENFJ,working around 8 years old
ENFJ_Out with the old.7,ENFJ,and I consider my work period when I was
ENFJ_Out with the old.8,ENFJ,trying to become an Olympic swimmer from
ENFJ_Out with the old.9,ENFJ,the age of 8 to 16 I swam about 4 to 5
ENFJ_Out with the old.10,ENFJ,hours a day it was very intense I woke
ENFJ_Out with the old.11,ENFJ,up at 4 a.m. in the morning I had strict
ENFJ_Out with the old.12,ENFJ,food diets and the way that I operated
ENFJ_Out with the old.13,ENFJ,in everyday life was just primarily
ENFJ_Out with the old.14,ENFJ,around hustling to succeed in my
ENFJ_Out with the old.15,ENFJ,swimming career around 12 I started
ENFJ_Out with the old.16,ENFJ,working to try to make money for myself
ENFJ_Out with the old.17,ENFJ,and save money I've always been very
ENFJ_Out with the old.18,ENFJ,much work success goal oriented so
ENFJ_Out with the old.19,ENFJ,everything for me was that the outcome I
ENFJ_Out with the old.20,ENFJ,wanted everything to succeed as fast as
ENFJ_Out with the old.21,ENFJ,possible so the idea of not working was
ENFJ_Out with the old.22,ENFJ,never part of my blood everyone that
ENFJ_Out with the old.23,ENFJ,knows me knows that I work too much I
ENFJ_Out with the old.24,ENFJ,don't know what it feels like to not
ENFJ_Out with the old.25,ENFJ,work my existence has been working 16 18
ENFJ_Out with the old.26,ENFJ,hour days all of my 20s in order to
ENFJ_Out with the old.27,ENFJ,succeed at my goals to achieve what I've
ENFJ_Out with the old.28,ENFJ,wanted to achieve my identity stems
ENFJ_Out with the old.29,ENFJ,around achievement success hustling
ENFJ_Out with the old.30,ENFJ,working more than other people and so
ENFJ_Out with the old.31,ENFJ,this year at the beginning of this year
ENFJ_Out with the old.32,ENFJ,I couldn't get myself to work no matter
ENFJ_Out with the old.33,ENFJ,what I did my ability to just edit one
ENFJ_Out with the old.34,ENFJ,video just went away to post one photo
ENFJ_Out with the old.35,ENFJ,just went away everything that I did
ENFJ_Out with the old.36,ENFJ,before I managed my website social media
ENFJ_Out with the old.37,ENFJ,I have worked side hustles I did so much
ENFJ_Out with the old.38,ENFJ,stuff and I know as an influencer it
ENFJ_Out with the old.39,ENFJ,looks like we do nothing but there is a
ENFJ_Out with the old.40,ENFJ,lot that goes into creation of an empire
ENFJ_Out with the old.41,ENFJ,and so therefore not being able to do
ENFJ_Out with the old.42,ENFJ,any work has shocked me of course I'm
ENFJ_Out with the old.43,ENFJ,thankful that I'm in a position that I
ENFJ_Out with the old.44,ENFJ,got myself to a position where I didn't
ENFJ_Out with the old.45,ENFJ,have to go to work I have financially
ENFJ_Out with the old.46,ENFJ,secured myself for the very first time
ENFJ_Out with the old.47,ENFJ,in my life which feels amazing to be
ENFJ_Out with the old.48,ENFJ,able to have a break from the hustle but
ENFJ_Out with the old.49,ENFJ,my intention was never to slow down my
ENFJ_Out with the old.50,ENFJ,video creation I remember people saying
ENFJ_Out with the old.51,ENFJ,to me that you burn out soon and that
ENFJ_Out with the old.52,ENFJ,you
ENFJ_Out with the old.53,ENFJ,get over it soon of creating videos and
ENFJ_Out with the old.54,ENFJ,all of this stuff and I was like I need
ENFJ_Out with the old.55,ENFJ,kidding I'm on a roll I'm creating two
ENFJ_Out with the old.56,ENFJ,videos a week it's easy-peasy kept and
ENFJ_Out with the old.57,ENFJ,breezy I'm pumping it out and doing
ENFJ_Out with the old.58,ENFJ,speeches around the world I'm travelling
ENFJ_Out with the old.59,ENFJ,full time like I've got this thing for
ENFJ_Out with the old.60,ENFJ,myself I've got it going on but alas my
ENFJ_Out with the old.61,ENFJ,body decided to take a different stance
ENFJ_Out with the old.62,ENFJ,and it forced me to sit down and lie
ENFJ_Out with the old.63,ENFJ,down on a couch more so and just self
ENFJ_Out with the old.64,ENFJ,reflect I have turned on this camera a
ENFJ_Out with the old.65,ENFJ,gazillion times trying to record a
ENFJ_Out with the old.66,ENFJ,videos and just the way that I did last
ENFJ_Out with the old.67,ENFJ,year just put on a smile and just keep
ENFJ_Out with the old.68,ENFJ,going and pump through it pump through
ENFJ_Out with the old.69,ENFJ,push through I have pages upon pages
ENFJ_Out with the old.70,ENFJ,upon pages of video topic ideas and I
ENFJ_Out with the old.71,ENFJ,just could not create it I have spoken
ENFJ_Out with the old.72,ENFJ,to a mozillian people about why I'm not
ENFJ_Out with the old.73,ENFJ,able to create youtubers that I'm
ENFJ_Out with the old.74,ENFJ,possibly going through the same thing
ENFJ_Out with the old.75,ENFJ,burn out something they call it I didn't
ENFJ_Out with the old.76,ENFJ,know what was happening and so I just
ENFJ_Out with the old.77,ENFJ,decided that it might be time to
ENFJ_Out with the old.78,ENFJ,surrender and if my you two days and my
ENFJ_Out with the old.79,ENFJ,creation days are over
ENFJ_Out with the old.80,ENFJ,so be it I guess there's something else
ENFJ_Out with the old.81,ENFJ,for me I don't know why I have this
ENFJ_Out with the old.82,ENFJ,resistance or inability to create
ENFJ_Out with the old.83,ENFJ,anything at all and so I have been
ENFJ_Out with the old.84,ENFJ,surrendering and I've been trying to see
ENFJ_Out with the old.85,ENFJ,what will happen on the other side
ENFJ_Out with the old.86,ENFJ,absolutely it's been scary because
ENFJ_Out with the old.87,ENFJ,imagine if I came out of this deciding
ENFJ_Out with the old.88,ENFJ,that no I don't want to do this YouTube
ENFJ_Out with the old.89,ENFJ,thing I don't want to be on social media
ENFJ_Out with the old.90,ENFJ,I don't want to be the face of something
ENFJ_Out with the old.91,ENFJ,about what if what if all of this stuff
ENFJ_Out with the old.92,ENFJ,that I've built up all of this effort
ENFJ_Out with the old.93,ENFJ,and time that I put into creating
ENFJ_Out with the old.94,ENFJ,something huge what if I decide it's not
ENFJ_Out with the old.95,ENFJ,what I want and I don't know the answer
ENFJ_Out with the old.96,ENFJ,to that yet to be honest all I know is
ENFJ_Out with the old.97,ENFJ,that this morning I just really wanted
ENFJ_Out with the old.98,ENFJ,to make this video and I wanted to
ENFJ_Out with the old.99,ENFJ,address some of the reasons why I think
ENFJ_Out with the old.100,ENFJ,I also stopped creating very much and
ENFJ_Out with the old.101,ENFJ,why I am grateful for this break so let
ENFJ_Out with the old.102,ENFJ,me start with why I think I stopped
ENFJ_Out with the old.103,ENFJ,creating so much I think the first wave
ENFJ_Out with the old.104,ENFJ,of youtubers was about people they just
ENFJ_Out with the old.105,ENFJ,wanted to create they were fascinated by
ENFJ_Out with the old.106,ENFJ,the idea that you could push upload and
ENFJ_Out with the old.107,ENFJ,then the world would see your message or
ENFJ_Out with the old.108,ENFJ,it could see your message
ENFJ_Out with the old.109,ENFJ,and even if there was 50 people watching
ENFJ_Out with the old.110,ENFJ,you were just overwhelmed that there
ENFJ_Out with the old.111,ENFJ,were 50 people watching now the new wave
ENFJ_Out with the old.112,ENFJ,of youtubers coming through it's awesome
ENFJ_Out with the old.113,ENFJ,because a lot of younger generations
ENFJ_Out with the old.114,ENFJ,they understand that this can be a big
ENFJ_Out with the old.115,ENFJ,moneymaker and a lot of the focus these
ENFJ_Out with the old.116,ENFJ,days is about creating a business using
ENFJ_Out with the old.117,ENFJ,YouTube my intention wasn't that I think
ENFJ_Out with the old.118,ENFJ,I like the idea and I always knew that I
ENFJ_Out with the old.119,ENFJ,would become a youtuber I don't know if
ENFJ_Out with the old.120,ENFJ,I knew what becoming a youtuber would
ENFJ_Out with the old.121,ENFJ,mean but now I am one and now I know
ENFJ_Out with the old.122,ENFJ,what it comes with the responsibility of
ENFJ_Out with the old.123,ENFJ,being on an online platform is pretty
ENFJ_Out with the old.124,ENFJ,significant and I don't even have a
ENFJ_Out with the old.125,ENFJ,reach that is very grand
ENFJ_Out with the old.126,ENFJ,I mean think of the people as the
ENFJ_Out with the old.127,ENFJ,Kardashians all these people with way
ENFJ_Out with the old.128,ENFJ,too much attention on them it's pretty
ENFJ_Out with the old.129,ENFJ,intense I feel sorry for them I really
ENFJ_Out with the old.130,ENFJ,feel sorry for them and I'm glad that my
ENFJ_Out with the old.131,ENFJ,platform stopped growing because I don't
ENFJ_Out with the old.132,ENFJ,I'm not dealing with it as well as I
ENFJ_Out with the old.133,ENFJ,thought I would for one I've realized
ENFJ_Out with the old.134,ENFJ,that I'm extremely empathetic and if
ENFJ_Out with the old.135,ENFJ,people are telling me you can't say that
ENFJ_Out with the old.136,ENFJ,because you're offending me because of
ENFJ_Out with the old.137,ENFJ,this and this and this or I'm not able
ENFJ_Out with the old.138,ENFJ,to understand all the knowledge in the
ENFJ_Out with the old.139,ENFJ,world
ENFJ_Out with the old.140,ENFJ,- a simple idea as when I was in Bali I
ENFJ_Out with the old.141,ENFJ,trialed Tim Ferriss his nighttime
ENFJ_Out with the old.142,ENFJ,routine which involves having a bath for
ENFJ_Out with the old.143,ENFJ,seven days and I didn't know that
ENFJ_Out with the old.144,ENFJ,California had droughts at the time and
ENFJ_Out with the old.145,ENFJ,people were telling me how can you
ENFJ_Out with the old.146,ENFJ,advocate having baths when we're in a
ENFJ_Out with the old.147,ENFJ,drought I don't know what's going on
ENFJ_Out with the old.148,ENFJ,around the world and I always ended up
ENFJ_Out with the old.149,ENFJ,feeling like a douche bag
ENFJ_Out with the old.150,ENFJ,for everything that I did because I
ENFJ_Out with the old.151,ENFJ,didn't have all the answers and I was it
ENFJ_Out with the old.152,ENFJ,got to me that wasn't even the bad
ENFJ_Out with the old.153,ENFJ,comments then there was the bad comments
ENFJ_Out with the old.154,ENFJ,and I realized I'm quite sensitive I
ENFJ_Out with the old.155,ENFJ,didn't know that I thought it was strong
ENFJ_Out with the old.156,ENFJ,and I thought I just could ignore it and
ENFJ_Out with the old.157,ENFJ,then they just got to me and it wasn't
ENFJ_Out with the old.158,ENFJ,feedback from people that I cared about
ENFJ_Out with the old.159,ENFJ,like people that I subscribed or watch
ENFJ_Out with the old.160,ENFJ,me regularly or know me well it was
ENFJ_Out with the old.161,ENFJ,people that didn't know me and they
ENFJ_Out with the old.162,ENFJ,called me names and horrible things for
ENFJ_Out with the old.163,ENFJ,no apparent reason because on the
ENFJ_Out with the old.164,ENFJ,internet especially YouTube that is the
ENFJ_Out with the old.165,ENFJ,most open flat platform for people to
ENFJ_Out with the old.166,ENFJ,"destroy you and if I had 50,000 views"
ENFJ_Out with the old.167,ENFJ,but I had five comments that
ENFJ_Out with the old.168,ENFJ,bad and the rest were great obviously as
ENFJ_Out with the old.169,ENFJ,human nature doors are concentrated on
ENFJ_Out with the old.170,ENFJ,those things on the five comments that
ENFJ_Out with the old.171,ENFJ,got me down because I didn't understand
ENFJ_Out with the old.172,ENFJ,why there wasn't it's like I needed
ENFJ_Out with the old.173,ENFJ,validation from all the people that
ENFJ_Out with the old.174,ENFJ,watch because part of me was also
ENFJ_Out with the old.175,ENFJ,thinking goes back to just immediately
ENFJ_Out with the old.176,ENFJ,"thinking bad that the people the 50,000"
ENFJ_Out with the old.177,ENFJ,people that watch my video but there's
ENFJ_Out with the old.178,ENFJ,"only 500 comments the 40/40 9,500 people"
ENFJ_Out with the old.179,ENFJ,that didn't comment what if they were
ENFJ_Out with the old.180,ENFJ,sitting there rolling their eyes and I
ENFJ_Out with the old.181,ENFJ,just had these worst-case scenarios so I
ENFJ_Out with the old.182,ENFJ,still I deal with that and I realized
ENFJ_Out with the old.183,ENFJ,that I was probably too open with the
ENFJ_Out with the old.184,ENFJ,person that I am I allowed people to see
ENFJ_Out with the old.185,ENFJ,straight into Who I am instead of making
ENFJ_Out with the old.186,ENFJ,this a business which I don't know if I
ENFJ_Out with the old.187,ENFJ,necessarily wanted to I think I wanted
ENFJ_Out with the old.188,ENFJ,to connect with people on the internet
ENFJ_Out with the old.189,ENFJ,that I liked me that think like me that
ENFJ_Out with the old.190,ENFJ,perhaps were outcasts in some time of
ENFJ_Out with the old.191,ENFJ,their life which I experienced quite a
ENFJ_Out with the old.192,ENFJ,lot of unmet ego the one that was told
ENFJ_Out with the old.193,ENFJ,that she was too much too intense too
ENFJ_Out with the old.194,ENFJ,outrageous too wild too crazy and I
ENFJ_Out with the old.195,ENFJ,wanted to find I guess some people that
ENFJ_Out with the old.196,ENFJ,I could be friends with but I have
ENFJ_Out with the old.197,ENFJ,learnt probably that I have to pull that
ENFJ_Out with the old.198,ENFJ,back and just concentrate on creating
ENFJ_Out with the old.199,ENFJ,messages and work and distancing myself
ENFJ_Out with the old.200,ENFJ,from opening up my heart to complete
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know0,ESTJ,[Music]
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know1,ESTJ,hey guys so today we're doing travel
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know2,ESTJ,light packs so travel with me as I show
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know3,ESTJ,you all my life hacks that make
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know4,ESTJ,traveling so much easier so my first
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know5,ESTJ,life hack for you guys is to try and get
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know6,ESTJ,airline credit so how the process
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know7,ESTJ,usually works is you'll get to the
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know8,ESTJ,airport you'll check in for your flight
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know9,ESTJ,and the kiosk will ask you if you want
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know10,ESTJ,to volunteer to be bumped to a different
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know11,ESTJ,flight that's how you know your flight
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know12,ESTJ,is definitely overbooked the airline
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know13,ESTJ,needs someone to get off this flight and
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know14,ESTJ,go to the next one so whoever does get
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know15,ESTJ,kicked off the flight is going to get
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know16,ESTJ,"airline credit so one time I got $1,000"
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know17,ESTJ,worth of airline credit for a flight
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know18,ESTJ,that was like two hours long so there's
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know19,ESTJ,three ways I know that you can really
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know20,ESTJ,increase your chances of getting this
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know21,ESTJ,you want any chance of doing this at all
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know22,ESTJ,then you have to fly on the busiest days
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know23,ESTJ,which are Fridays Saturdays Sundays and
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know24,ESTJ,Mondays especially Monday mornings and
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know25,ESTJ,Friday night after that you want to get
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know26,ESTJ,to the gate as soon as possible and let
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know27,ESTJ,them know that you're down to be bumped
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know28,ESTJ,onto the next flight so you pretty much
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know29,ESTJ,have to go up to the gate and let them
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know30,ESTJ,know or they're just going to ask the
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know31,ESTJ,people who don't have seeds assigned
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know32,ESTJ,still sometimes they go through all the
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know33,ESTJ,people with unassigned seats and they
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know34,ESTJ,still ask on the intercom one time I was
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know35,ESTJ,"even on a flight and they offered 1,300"
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know36,ESTJ,dollars to get someone off of it like
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know37,ESTJ,everyone was already sitting down on the
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know38,ESTJ,flight so even if you have a seat
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know39,ESTJ,assigned it's still possible to another
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know40,ESTJ,way in trying to get overbooked flights
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know41,ESTJ,is to check the seat map when you're
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know42,ESTJ,booking guys let's say I need a flight
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know43,ESTJ,from Seattle to LA as you can see this
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know44,ESTJ,two flights for one hundred and sixty
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know45,ESTJ,dollars each so the first flight has 32
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know46,ESTJ,seats on it and the second flight only
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know47,ESTJ,has 20 so if I want to get on an
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know48,ESTJ,overbooked flight which one do you think

ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know59,ESTJ,it yet because you think it's going to
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know60,ESTJ,be like a very annoying process but
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know61,ESTJ,actually for me all it was was 10
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know62,ESTJ,minutes on my computer putting
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know63,ESTJ,information in and then I went into the

ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know81,ESTJ,to make sure that I'm actually going to
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know82,ESTJ,have an outlet okay let's talk about
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know83,ESTJ,first cuff upgrades so flying
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know84,ESTJ,first-class obviously is super nice but
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know85,ESTJ,who wants to pay for it
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know86,ESTJ,wait not me there's two ways to get it
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know87,ESTJ,for free
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know88,ESTJ,one is by having status with the airline
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know89,ESTJ,so if you fly often like twice a month
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know90,ESTJ,then you should really stick to one
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know91,ESTJ,airline I stick to one airline and that
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know92,ESTJ,allows me to get the lowest level of
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know93,ESTJ,status and you would think with the
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know94,ESTJ,lowest level status like you're not ever
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know95,ESTJ,going to get upgraded I actually have
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know96,ESTJ,about not graded little trick to
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know97,ESTJ,increase your chances of getting
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know98,ESTJ,upgraded you do the exact opposite that
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know99,ESTJ,you would do if you're trying to get on
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know100,ESTJ,an overbooked flight so if you're trying
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know101,ESTJ,to get upgraded look at the seat map and
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know102,ESTJ,see which has the most first-class still
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know103,ESTJ,open can't really try and get on an
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know104,ESTJ,overbooked flight then so you gotta pick
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know105,ESTJ,one so with Delta even if you don't get
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know106,ESTJ,a first class upgrade I get comfort plus
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know107,ESTJ,pretty much every time which is also
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know108,ESTJ,nice like you get a premium beverage you
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know109,ESTJ,get a free snack you get a little more
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know110,ESTJ,legroom and to me the best part you get
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know111,ESTJ,to be near the front of a plane so you
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know112,ESTJ,can get off quickly and just get to your
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know113,ESTJ,destination time for a hotel room light
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know114,ESTJ,pack okay while I was checking in one
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know115,ESTJ,time I asked like if I could get a
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know116,ESTJ,rollaway bed and it turned out that to
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know117,ESTJ,get a rollaway bed you needed a bigger
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know118,ESTJ,room on a higher floor with a city view
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know119,ESTJ,so they upgraded me for free so this one
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know120,ESTJ,may not work all the time and you should
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know121,ESTJ,really only do it when you actually need
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know122,ESTJ,to roll with it pretty awesome because
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know123,ESTJ,the city view is way better than looking
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know124,ESTJ,at a wall that pretty much just looks
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know125,ESTJ,like this so you're at a hotel and you
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know126,ESTJ,forgot your phone charger it happens to
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know127,ESTJ,me way more often than I'd like to admit
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know128,ESTJ,so if you saw the actual cable you are
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know129,ESTJ,in luck because the back of every TV
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know130,ESTJ,actually has a
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know131,ESTJ,USB thing we just plug it right into
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know132,ESTJ,there just a little note on this one
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know133,ESTJ,usually you have to actually turn the TV
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know134,ESTJ,on or it's not going to charge it so
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know135,ESTJ,just make sure you do that and it should
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know136,ESTJ,work but if you lost the entire thing
ESTJ_10 Travel Life Hacks You NEED To Know137,ESTJ,before you go buy a new one ask the

ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials21,ENTJ,carry-on for what I bring on the plane
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials22,ENTJ,for the journey itself and not like
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials23,ENTJ,necessarily clothes and whatnot but kind
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials24,ENTJ,of for the travel portion but without
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials25,ENTJ,further ado let me show you guys what I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials26,ENTJ,packing my carry-on so first and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials27,ENTJ,foremost is the bag you are bringing I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials28,ENTJ,very rarely travel with like fashion in
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials29,ENTJ,mind it's more like convenience I'm
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials30,ENTJ,trying to be smart it's like in the past
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials31,ENTJ,I've traveled with like tote bags and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials32,ENTJ,stuff like that but I realized it's just
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials33,ENTJ,so key to have a good backpack
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials34,ENTJ,this one's from away and I love it cuz
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials35,ENTJ,it has a ton of pockets as this laptop
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials36,ENTJ,slip right here and it's large enough
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials37,ENTJ,that I can fit my camera equipment in
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials38,ENTJ,here so this is my go-to bag first and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials39,ENTJ,foremost especially on our modern day is
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials40,ENTJ,technology so when it comes to the
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials41,ENTJ,airplane I want to make sure I always
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials42,ENTJ,have a pair of headphones I could not
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials43,ENTJ,survive a long flight without them I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials44,ENTJ,usually bring actually two pairs of
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials45,ENTJ,headphones so I have these these are
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials46,ENTJ,noise cancelling
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials47,ENTJ,I love these it's great to block out
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials48,ENTJ,screaming babies and just to listen to
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials49,ENTJ,like ambience music and kind of zoom out
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials50,ENTJ,so feel like a DJ when I wear them which
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials51,ENTJ,is a plus maybe not a cool one but you
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials52,ENTJ,know DJ vibes it's important to bring
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials53,ENTJ,headphones with a jack like this because
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials54,ENTJ,on airplanes if you don't watch a movie
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials55,ENTJ,at most of the jacks are usually this
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials56,ENTJ,size they're not gonna be the size of
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials57,ENTJ,the newer iPhone headphones so make sure
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials58,ENTJ,you have this jack or at least an
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials59,ENTJ,adapter of some sort so you can watch a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials60,ENTJ,movies to bear through the long hours
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials61,ENTJ,the YouTuber having your laptop is
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials62,ENTJ,crucial I mean I always
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials63,ENTJ,with me almost everywhere I go because
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials64,ENTJ,I'm constantly editing and working and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials65,ENTJ,any little time gaps that I have so I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials66,ENTJ,always bring this with me as well as a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials67,ENTJ,computer charger and of course an iPhone
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials68,ENTJ,charger both days are crucial because
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials69,ENTJ,it's a long play now there are a little
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials70,ENTJ,piece of technology that I highly
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials71,ENTJ,recommend bringing on a long trip is a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials72,ENTJ,external iPhone charger like one of
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials73,ENTJ,these little guys because you never know
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials74,ENTJ,if your airplane might not have an
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials75,ENTJ,outlet for you to plug in and trust me
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials76,ENTJ,in our day and age you do not want to
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials77,ENTJ,have a dead phone while traveling I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials78,ENTJ,literally rely on it for everything I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials79,ENTJ,often have like my ticket saved on it I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials80,ENTJ,use it to call an uber or whatever find
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials81,ENTJ,the bus I need to take once I arrive in
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials82,ENTJ,the airport I check on it for like
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials83,ENTJ,transfers so basically I highly
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials84,ENTJ,recommend bringing one of these just in
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials85,ENTJ,case something happens
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials86,ENTJ,you want to be able to have your phone a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials87,ENTJ,charged uber I always have a camera with
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials88,ENTJ,me but I'm using my canon g7x right now
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials89,ENTJ,to film so I always bring that little
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials90,ENTJ,guy with me but I also love bringing
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials91,ENTJ,disposable it's kind of like a personal
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials92,ENTJ,preference but I just love the look of
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials93,ENTJ,film because each moment is kind of
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials94,ENTJ,capture a more meaningful way and it's
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials95,ENTJ,more selective and because you're really
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials96,ENTJ,small and easy to carry around which is
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials97,ENTJ,a plus
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials98,ENTJ,[Music]
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials99,ENTJ,for entertainment for a long flight I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials100,ENTJ,usually bring a book of some sort I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials101,ENTJ,highly recommend bringing a small
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials102,ENTJ,paperback book if you're going somewhere
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials103,ENTJ,we're gonna be carrying your luggage
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials104,ENTJ,personally like far distances you really
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials105,ENTJ,want to minimize the amount of weight
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials106,ENTJ,you have on your back also something
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials107,ENTJ,I've learned the hard way so I like to
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials108,ENTJ,just find a small nice read to keep me
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials109,ENTJ,company on a long flight or a long train
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials110,ENTJ,ride so another thing I always bring
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials111,ENTJ,with me on my carry-on is my journal I'm
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials112,ENTJ,an avid journal er I love to journal and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials113,ENTJ,just kind of capture how I'm feeling and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials114,ENTJ,the memories that I've experienced about
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials115,ENTJ,where I'm going or where I've been even
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials116,ENTJ,maybe how it changed me or hiker for a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials117,ENTJ,really unique experience so I love
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials118,ENTJ,bringing this with me
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials119,ENTJ,so hand-in-hand with that obviously you
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials120,ENTJ,need a bomb pen of course one thing that
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials121,ENTJ,took me a while to realize from a lot of
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials122,ENTJ,different trips but I should carry with
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials123,ENTJ,me and carry on is a glue stick and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials124,ENTJ,might seem a little obscure but that is
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials125,ENTJ,because I personally when journaling
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials126,ENTJ,loved to collect like little metro
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials127,ENTJ,tickets and like museum ticket stubs and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials128,ENTJ,like concert ticket stuff like that and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials129,ENTJ,I love to kind of have those like little
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials130,ENTJ,physical pieces a memory for longest
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials131,ENTJ,time I would just collect like a big
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials132,ENTJ,pile from each trip of different little
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials133,ENTJ,like paper mementos but then like I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials134,ENTJ,ended up getting back to like my home
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials135,ENTJ,and then I was getting like backlog with
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials136,ENTJ,like other things I wanted a journal
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials137,ENTJ,about and I would end up losing little
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials138,ENTJ,pieces of paper so basically I think
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials139,ENTJ,it's super valuable to just bring a glue
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials140,ENTJ,stick with you so when you like find a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials141,ENTJ,cool museum tick you I can just Lou it
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials142,ENTJ,in there and then journal a little bit
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials143,ENTJ,about it or like to put a Polaroid or
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials144,ENTJ,like a pressed flower or whatever it is
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials145,ENTJ,you prefer in there immediately rather
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials146,ENTJ,than like relying on your future self to
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials147,ENTJ,glue it in weeks later just something
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials148,ENTJ,that's helped me
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials149,ENTJ,[Music]
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials150,ENTJ,and now moving on to like snacks and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials151,ENTJ,like things I will consume that I carry
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials152,ENTJ,on my carry on this isn't me being like
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials153,ENTJ,trendy healthy TK 19
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials154,ENTJ,I like legitimately highly recommend
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials155,ENTJ,bringing healthy snacks with you on the
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials156,ENTJ,airplane because you will feel so much
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials157,ENTJ,better if you're putting something good
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials158,ENTJ,in your body and then something like
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials159,ENTJ,processed and gross like trust me I've
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials160,ENTJ,tried it both ways we're like I'll go on
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials161,ENTJ,some flights and I'll just buy a crap
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials162,ENTJ,ton of candy and eat it all and you
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials163,ENTJ,literally feel awful especially when
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials164,ENTJ,you're sitting in a cramped space in the
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials165,ENTJ,sky in a small little chair for like 7
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials166,ENTJ,hours at a time and if you just picked
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials167,ENTJ,out on like a bunch of skittles you're
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials168,ENTJ,gonna feel like crap yet something
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials169,ENTJ,that's gonna like fuel your body in a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials170,ENTJ,positive way you will feel so so much
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials171,ENTJ,better when you're in the airport
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials172,ENTJ,airport food is insanely expensive and
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials173,ENTJ,then when you're on the airplane
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials174,ENTJ,airplane food is just genuinely pretty
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials175,ENTJ,gross I usually bring like something I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials176,ENTJ,can snack on like I have these little
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials177,ENTJ,green Appy a snack crisps something like
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials178,ENTJ,this I usually always bring protein bars
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials179,ENTJ,in my absolute favorite protein bars are
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials180,ENTJ,macro bars they couldn't find in the
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials181,ENTJ,grocery store so I also like rx these
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials182,ENTJ,ones are super good for you there's a
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials183,ENTJ,lot of protein bars out there that
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials184,ENTJ,actually highly recommend macro or rx
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials185,ENTJ,just gonna give you a little fuel also
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials186,ENTJ,gum so you can just chew on it when you
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials187,ENTJ,are taking off or landing if your ears
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials188,ENTJ,pop or just you know keep you busy run
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials189,ENTJ,your board definitely it brings your own
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials190,ENTJ,water bottle not only is it sustainable
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials191,ENTJ,but they usually give you like this much
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials192,ENTJ,water when you're on an airplane so I
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials193,ENTJ,recommend this to keep you hydrated
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials194,ENTJ,I also recommend bringing some type of
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials195,ENTJ,dietary supplement or vitamin of some
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials196,ENTJ,sort is it so hard to eat while in your
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials197,ENTJ,traveling like I said airplane food
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials198,ENTJ,isn't usually not that good or very
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials199,ENTJ,healthy and if it's a long flight or an
ENTJ_What's In My Carry On & Travel Essentials200,ENTJ,overnight flight or if you're changing

of your comfort zone"""
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt3,ENFPc,"is thrown around so much today
online and in motivational quotes"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt4,ENFPc,that it's begun to lose its meaning.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt5,ENFPc,"And this is because
we don't clearly understand"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt6,ENFPc,"what our comfort zone is,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt7,ENFPc,and it seems counterintuitive to leave it
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt8,ENFPc,because it's where we feel the most safe.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt9,ENFPc,"It also sounds like
we're sugar-coating something"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt10,ENFPc,"that we don't want to talk about,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt11,ENFPc,which is fear.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt12,ENFPc,"Let me tell you a bit more about my story
and how fear has played a role in it."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt13,ENFPc,I come from a family of travelers.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt14,ENFPc,"My mom started a travel agency
when she was younger than I am now,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt15,ENFPc,"and growing up they never left me behind
when they went on their adventures."

from community college"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt17,ENFPc,by the time I turned 18.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt18,ENFPc,"And at that time I had traveled
to around 70 countries."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt19,ENFPc,This was the point in my life
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt20,ENFPc,where people began to ask me
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt21,ENFPc,"the most intimidating question
that you can ask a young person:"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt22,ENFPc,"""What are you going to do next?"""
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt23,ENFPc,"And in attempt to answer that question,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt24,ENFPc,"I began by asking myself
what I was most passionate about,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt25,ENFPc,"which has always been travelling,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt26,ENFPc,"and how to make the most
out of the cards that I was dealt,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt27,ENFPc,"which was how much
travel experience I've had at my age."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt28,ENFPc,That's when it dawned on me.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt29,ENFPc,"I had over six years
to break the world record"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt30,ENFPc,"for the youngest person

that I was looking for"

and into the real world."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt33,ENFPc,"In retrospect, I had no idea
what I was getting myself into."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt34,ENFPc,"Flash-forward two and a half years later,
and I spent countless hours"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt35,ENFPc,"crammed on planes, trains,
chicken buses, tuk-tuks and junk boats"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt36,ENFPc,travelling with nothing but a backpack.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt37,ENFPc,"I have encountered health issues,
spanning from malaria in West Africa"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt38,ENFPc,"to hospital-worthy

ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt41,ENFPc,"and I endured the brain-sizzling
frustration of dealing with bureaucrats"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt42,ENFPc,from every country that requires a visa.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt43,ENFPc,"Believe it or not, these have been
some of my most treasured memories"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt44,ENFPc,"because they were the most
defining moments of my life,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt45,ENFPc,"spent far, far away from my comfort zone."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt46,ENFPc,"Proving to Guiness World Records
that I have traveled to every country"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt47,ENFPc,was a completely different story.

pack of guidelines,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt49,ENFPc,"I'm required to submit
everything from plane tickets"

two people in each country"

ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt54,ENFPc,"that would be willing
to help me with my witness statements."

officers at every border"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt56,ENFPc,"to please stamp my passport
with enough ink,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt57,ENFPc,"to be able to read the name and the date
on the passport stamp."

nearly 10,000 pieces of evidence"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt59,ENFPc,"in chronological order,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt60,ENFPc,"documenting how I entered
and exited each country,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt61,ENFPc,"along with a detailed itinerary
of what I did in each place."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt62,ENFPc,"Beyond this very overwhelming
amount of paperwork,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt63,ENFPc,"somewhere along this journey,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt64,ENFPc,"I discovered that there was
more than one element of my comfort zone"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt65,ENFPc,"that I was going to have to get out of
to get to where I wanted to go."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt66,ENFPc,"I now believe that there is a correlation
between our comfort zone"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt67,ENFPc,"and our mind, body and soul."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt68,ENFPc,"If you know that
you have fears in general,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt69,ENFPc,"knowing exactly where
those fears are stemming from"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt70,ENFPc,is the first step towards overcoming them.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt71,ENFPc,"I personally have a few
very distinct fears."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt72,ENFPc,"I am afraid of heights, which stems
from my physical comfort zone."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt73,ENFPc,"I have - I had a fear of being alone,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt74,ENFPc,"which was completely
controlled by my mind."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt75,ENFPc,"And I also am terrified of regret,
which comes straight from my soul."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt76,ENFPc,The reason why so many people
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt77,ENFPc,"are unsuccessful at getting
out of their comfort zone"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt78,ENFPc,"is because our comfort zone
is not just one thing."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt79,ENFPc,It's three.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt80,ENFPc,"The first is obvious,
our physical comfort zone."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt81,ENFPc,"Naturally, what we fear most is death."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt82,ENFPc,"We're evolutionarily wired to avoid
situations where we could get hurt."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt83,ENFPc,"And that's why every cell
in my body was screaming"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt84,ENFPc,"when I was standing on the edge
of a 750-foot drop in Switzerland."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt85,ENFPc,The opportunity came up to bungee jump

platform in the world,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt87,ENFPc,"and being someone that was
always too afraid to jump off of rocks"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt88,ENFPc,"into the water at the river,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt89,ENFPc,"this was by far my greatest fear,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt90,ENFPc,and the idea of facing it head-on
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt91,ENFPc,"excited me just as much
as it terrified me."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt92,ENFPc,"When they strapped in my ankles
and perched me on the edge,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt93,ENFPc,I was shaking.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt94,ENFPc,Three ...

ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt97,ENFPc,I plunged into seven and a half seconds
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt98,ENFPc,"of the most intense sensory overload
I had ever experienced."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt99,ENFPc,Complete terror turned into utter euphoria
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt100,ENFPc,"and resulted in one of the most
significant moments of my life."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt101,ENFPc,"In that moment, I realized that I was
capable of pushing my body's limits"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt102,ENFPc,"and that it's something
that's actually worth doing."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt103,ENFPc,I realized what was possible
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt104,ENFPc,"and became instantly hooked
on the rush of having new experiences."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt105,ENFPc,"Little did I know at the time
that facing my biggest fear"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt106,ENFPc,"was what would ultimately lead me to
travelling to every country in the world,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt107,ENFPc,"and out of 196 countries,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt108,ENFPc,"I have only found myself
in real, physical danger one time."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt109,ENFPc,"I traveled to Yemen as a photographer

outside of my hotel."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt113,ENFPc,I jumped out of bed and ran to the window
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt114,ENFPc,"to see that there were 50 or so men
congregated in the parking lot,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt115,ENFPc,"yelling and pushing each other around,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt116,ENFPc,with six cars with flashing headlights
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt117,ENFPc,blocking the only exit.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt118,ENFPc,"With no security in sight,"

to call my contact in the country,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt120,ENFPc,who didn't answer
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt121,ENFPc,"because this was happening
around 2:00 in the morning."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt122,ENFPc,"I could hear voices
outside of my hotel room"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt123,ENFPc,"even though I knew that we were
the only people staying in the hotel."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt124,ENFPc,"That was the first time I had ever heard
a fully automatic weapon discharged."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt125,ENFPc,"I literally ducked
and looked around the room"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt126,ENFPc,"realistically looking
for the best place to hide."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt127,ENFPc,"In that moment,
there was nothing I could do"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt128,ENFPc,"but sit with my fear
of potentially being kidnapped,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt129,ENFPc,"until eventually, all the men disappeared,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt130,ENFPc,"and I could cry myself to sleep
after the adrenaline wore off."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt131,ENFPc,"The next morning, I called -
I talked to my contact in the country"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt132,ENFPc,"and asked him what had happened
the night before."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt133,ENFPc,"He responded with,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt134,ENFPc,"""Oh, that?"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt135,ENFPc,"That was just a wedding party."""

ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt137,ENFPc,"Since Yemen is an Islamic country,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt138,ENFPc,"they do not drink alcohol,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt139,ENFPc,"and one of the ways
that they celebrate is by shooting guns."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt140,ENFPc,"Basically, what this means"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt141,ENFPc,"is the this scariest thing that
has ever happened to me while travelling"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt142,ENFPc,"was only scary because
I didn't fully understand the culture."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt143,ENFPc,The fun didn't stop there.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt144,ENFPc,"Getting out of the comfort zone
that I had created around myself mentally"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt145,ENFPc,"would prove to be
an even greater challenge"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt146,ENFPc,and would require me to develop
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt147,ENFPc,"an entirely different aspect
of my character."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt148,ENFPc,We are creatures of habit.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt149,ENFPc,"We are most comfortable with things
we can easily understand and predict."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt150,ENFPc,We fill our lives with routines.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt151,ENFPc,"We wake up, go to class or work,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt152,ENFPc,"eat our meals,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt153,ENFPc,"maybe work out and go to sleep
at basically the same times every day."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt154,ENFPc,"We surround ourselves with the same
stable relationships for years."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt155,ENFPc,"We try so hard to live up
to other people's expectations of us"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt156,ENFPc,"that sometimes we let our passions
take the back seat"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt157,ENFPc,"because ultimately we don't want
to become isolated from our society."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt158,ENFPc,"After I traveled to the first
hundred or so countries,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt159,ENFPc,"the destinations became
more and more obscure,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt160,ENFPc,"and I stopped being able to talk
my friends and family into coming with me."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt161,ENFPc,"If you've never traveled for an extended
period of time by yourself before,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt162,ENFPc,"it might be hard to imagine
what it's like to spend days in transit"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt163,ENFPc,"on airplanes, in airports,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt164,ENFPc,"just to end up in an empty hotel room
by yourself at the end of the night."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt165,ENFPc,"After months of this for me,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt166,ENFPc,"it resulted in intense loneliness,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt167,ENFPc,"which was something
I didn't even realize I feared"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt168,ENFPc,"because I had been sheltered
from it my whole life."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt169,ENFPc,"At the peak of my time spent alone,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt170,ENFPc,"I found myself in the tiny
island nation of Tuvalu,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt171,ENFPc,"in the south Pacific with a population
of only 11,000 people."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt172,ENFPc,"I spent four days
in the capital, Funafuti,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt173,ENFPc,"because that's how often
flights go in and out of the country."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt174,ENFPc,"There was no Wi-Fi, no cell reception,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt175,ENFPc,"no connection to the outside world
whatsoever other than a small post office,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt176,ENFPc,"which happened to also be the country's
number one tourist attraction."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt177,ENFPc,"When I thought that I would be spending
my time in Tuvalu completely alone"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt178,ENFPc,"and without any distraction,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt179,ENFPc,"I noticed the only
other foreigner on the island."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt180,ENFPc,"She was a kindergarten teacher
from the South Side of Chicago"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt181,ENFPc,"who also happened to be travelling
to every country."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt182,ENFPc,"We bonded so quickly and deeply
over all of our shared experiences"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt183,ENFPc,"that we ended up going
from complete strangers"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt184,ENFPc,"to travelling to Fiji, Tonga, Chad,
Central African Republic"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt185,ENFPc,and Saudi Arabia together.
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt186,ENFPc,From the seven and a half months
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt187,ENFPc,"I spent travelling alone
to 50 or so countries,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt188,ENFPc,"I learned how to be alone
without being lonely,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt189,ENFPc,"and this did wonders
for my self-confidence,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt190,ENFPc,"but it also completely changed the way
that I think about the people in my life."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt191,ENFPc,"Now I have an appreciation
for the time that I get to spend"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt192,ENFPc,"with the people that I care about the most
in a way that I used to take for granted,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt193,ENFPc,"before I knew what it was
truly like to be alone."
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt194,ENFPc,"I also discovered that we have
so much more in common"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt195,ENFPc,"with people around the world
than you may think,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt196,ENFPc,"because ultimately
we all want the same things,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt197,ENFPc,which is why
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt198,ENFPc,"at the root of our spiritual comfort zone,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt199,ENFPc,"the layer closest to our souls,"
ENFPc_Life Lessons from the Youngest Person to Travel to Every Country | Lexie Alford | TEDxKlagenfurt200,ENFPc,we are all looking for fulfillment.
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!0,ENFPc,"Good morning, everyone from Seoul it feels so good to be back. I'm finally over the jetlag"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!1,ENFPc,I fully adjusted to the Korea time zone and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!2,ENFPc,Good news is it's looking very sunny today the moment I landed it was very gloomy
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!3,ENFPc,rained a lot and I just didn't want to film videos in such a dark mood and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!4,ENFPc,Now that I feel like myself again. I wanted to do a sit-down video giving you guys an update on my
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!5,ENFPc,apartment situation
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!6,ENFPc,so I'm moving and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!7,ENFPc,I know I didn't really have the chance to update you guys ever since I filmed the apartment hunting video
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!8,ENFPc,But it's happening apartment. Hunting was so stressful first off
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!9,ENFPc,It is extremely hot during the summer time
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!10,ENFPc,and so walking from one apartment to another it was a
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!11,ENFPc,struggle and to a lot of the places weren't big enough or it was too pricey and I just felt really
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!12,ENFPc,Discouraged but I finally found an apartment that I will be showing you guys
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!13,ENFPc,Later on in the upcoming weeks because I will be moving out of this apartment very very soon
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!14,ENFPc,And so I'm gonna show you guys the moving process because now I have so much stuff like a couch to move a refrigerator
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!15,ENFPc,TV stands desks beds
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!16,ENFPc,So I'm gonna show you guys that process and I'm going to film the current apartment tour
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!17,ENFPc,Because there are rooms that I didn't really share officially on my channels. So stay tuned
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!18,ENFPc,No less static intros outros
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!19,ENFPc,today's John Day is just going to be a sit-down and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!20,ENFPc,"A little bit of the serious type of video, I guess so before getting started"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!21,ENFPc,I wanted to cover the three different options you guys have for an apartment
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!22,ENFPc,The first is worse' which is a monthly rent
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!23,ENFPc,You pay a deposit and then you pay monthly
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!24,ENFPc,The second is Chauncey where you pay a bigger
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!25,ENFPc,Deposit and you don't have to pay that monthly rent and the third option is to buy the place
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!26,ENFPc,So the most frequently asked that I received was why are the deposits so high?
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!27,ENFPc,Basically the landlord earns money by investing in it and they make money off of interest
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!28,ENFPc,every month
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!29,ENFPc,so that's why the deposits are so high deposits can range from your monthly rent price all the way to
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!30,ENFPc,"Six hundred thousand dollars, and I'm not exaggerating with you"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!31,ENFPc,it really
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!32,ENFPc,depends on
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!33,ENFPc,How big your apartment is where your apartment is how?
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!34,ENFPc,New the apartment is and of course the owner it's really up to the owner of the apartment
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!35,ENFPc,"Do you get the deposit back? Yes, how much of it do you get back?"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!36,ENFPc,It really depends on the landlord but so far
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!37,ENFPc,I've always got all of it back and my friends also shared that they didn't get any of it deducted as well
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!38,ENFPc,"They usually get all of it back. But again, it really depends on your landlord. Let's talk about location"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!39,ENFPc,living in Seoul is expensive living an apartment in Seoul can be very expensive and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!40,ENFPc,there is comic book and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!41,ENFPc,"Kana, and of course condom is going to be a lot more expensive"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!42,ENFPc,I do have friends who live in calm down and they do say that whenever they come over
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!43,ENFPc,They always point out that my space is a lot bigger yet
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!44,ENFPc,They pay a lot more or they pay a similar price for a smaller space. So
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!45,ENFPc,Con book is a lot cheaper than con man. My first year in Korea. I actually lived in Charlotte
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!46,ENFPc,oh and book pool to be more specific and the school that I worked for paid for my
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!47,ENFPc,Accommodation and I found out that it was 300 or 400 dollars a month
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!48,ENFPc,"I'm going to start my own tour now, okay?"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!49,ENFPc,When I move to Seoul I live in the sunshine woman University area and of course college areas can be a lot cheaper
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!50,ENFPc,I
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!51,ENFPc,Remember painting I think about
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!52,ENFPc,$600 a month for that one room
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!53,ENFPc,And of course that is on the expensive side for Assumption University
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!54,ENFPc,But I wanted like a clean new space and that's why I went with that officetel
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!55,ENFPc,so those are like two examples outside of
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!56,ENFPc,My current apartment right now and if you guys are curious about my current apartment
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!57,ENFPc,I pay about a thousand five hundred a month and the deposit for this place was 50k
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!58,ENFPc,a
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!59,ENFPc,Lot of you guys were shocked by how I am moving out of this place already
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!60,ENFPc,But it's because I didn't purchase the place and ideally I wanted to renew the contract but the owner
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!61,ENFPc,wanted to
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!62,ENFPc,Lease it up for chums head instead of horses
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!63,ENFPc,Why don't you just buy instead of renting now if it was America?
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!64,ENFPc,it would be a lot different for me because as an American I can pull out loans and I can talk to my bank and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!65,ENFPc,"Figure something out, but here in Korea"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!66,ENFPc,I am a foreigner and it's not easy for a foreigner to just pull out a loan. It just doesn't work that way
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!67,ENFPc,It's the law and it makes sense
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!68,ENFPc,so those are the frequently asked questions and the next thing that I noticed that a lot of people pointed out was the numbers and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!69,ENFPc,If they were confused if I meant it in dollars or one and I did mean it in dollars
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!70,ENFPc,I'm sorry for confusing you guys. It's because for example all Chun is 5000 or chump or is
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!71,ENFPc,"$5,000 or Chun man on is about"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!72,ENFPc,"$50,000. So while editing I did edit in the correct"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!73,ENFPc,Price for each of the apartment. So everything you read on screen is correct. And so I just wanted to clarify that and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!74,ENFPc,I think that's about it
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!75,ENFPc,I really want to film the current apartment tour because it is the first apartment that I saved up for so
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!76,ENFPc,I'm going to clean my apartment and also pack I have a lot of
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!77,ENFPc,organization that I need to get done and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!78,ENFPc,I'm going to look at the new
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!79,ENFPc,Apartments layout to see how I want to arrange the furniture. So it's going to be a lot of
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!80,ENFPc,planning today and so
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!81,ENFPc,Let's start with the beauty room. It's gotten a lot better since the last time I do have to organize it though
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!82,ENFPc,"Yeah, so maybe you guys will get an aesthetic talk show. All right, let's go clean"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!83,ENFPc,So an update on this room. I actually got a lot of the beauty products organized
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!84,ENFPc,let me show you most of the beauty products are organized now that box is for my friends and family and
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!85,ENFPc,Maybe we'll do a giveaway for those products today. I'm going to focus on clothes. This is a chair
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!86,ENFPc,full of
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!87,ENFPc,Clothes that I need to organize and I'm going to take a closer. Look at this. The rack is falling down
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!88,ENFPc,So I'm going to look at this today and try to get this fixed
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!89,ENFPc,"For clothes, I am probably going to donate"
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!90,ENFPc,And I think my friends also wanted to take a look at them
ENFPc_I'M MOVING!91,ENFPc,So that's the plan

"ESTJc_i solo travelled to banff, canada and it was amazing64",ESTJc,present-day location whilst the Pacific
"ESTJc_i solo travelled to banff, canada and it was amazing65",ESTJc,tectonic plate was thrust upon us and it

ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA31,ESTPc,the concrete of New York City and
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA32,ESTPc,running on the beach but the running out
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA33,ESTPc,here has been fantastic and beyond just
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA34,ESTPc,the environment the weather it's like
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA35,ESTPc,this every single day it's never not
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA36,ESTPc,sunny here but I've also been but I've

ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA39,ESTPc,running it's like it's easier on the

ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA42,ESTPc,[Music]
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA43,ESTPc,little things like I go everywhere on

ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA46,ESTPc,are kind of come Plus room for a
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA47,ESTPc,passenger usually my passenger is
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA48,ESTPc,Francine not not Dan and yeah I always
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA49,ESTPc,make sure that the kids wearing a helmet
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA50,ESTPc,when she's on the electric bike when
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA51,ESTPc,she's on the super 73 with me the other
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA52,ESTPc,thing I've been doing a lot up here that
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA53,ESTPc,I really enjoy is surfing I'm pointing
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA54,ESTPc,to this surfboard here I say that was a
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA55,ESTPc,gift from YouTube surfing something I've
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA56,ESTPc,always wanted to do I always wanted to
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA57,ESTPc,learn I've always wanted to be good at
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA58,ESTPc,but I've never really had the
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA59,ESTPc,opportunity but kind of close to the
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA60,ESTPc,beach here so I've I've been doing it
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA61,ESTPc,yeah I just love being on the water I
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA62,ESTPc,also love being away from cellphones and
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA63,ESTPc,being away from social media and being
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA64,ESTPc,away from other people and being in
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA65,ESTPc,nature certain things very quickly
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA66,ESTPc,becoming my second favorite sport but I
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA67,ESTPc,haven't been surfing much lately
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA68,ESTPc,you see I broke my collarbone here a
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA69,ESTPc,couple weeks ago it was a pretty severe
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA70,ESTPc,break so you'd characterize that as
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA71,ESTPc,severe so that's that's that's like the
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA72,ESTPc,fun stuff I've been doing those are the
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA73,ESTPc,activities I've been doing to pass the
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA74,ESTPc,time and try my best to like you know
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA75,ESTPc,and enjoy the fun parts of life but all
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA76,ESTPc,that all that enjoying life and building
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA77,ESTPc,a life around family and all this fun
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA78,ESTPc,stuff that I've been doing since we
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA79,ESTPc,moved here all of that is in the shadow
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA80,ESTPc,of what was like the hardest probably
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA81,ESTPc,most tumultuous like five years of my
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA82,ESTPc,life professionally as long as you've
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA83,ESTPc,known me work has been my life and
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA84,ESTPc,everything else including family has
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA85,ESTPc,been on the sidelines and I've never
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA86,ESTPc,been like I've never been honest with
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA87,ESTPc,myself about thaks I think it took
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA88,ESTPc,taking a minute to look at it we're just
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA89,ESTPc,I've been doing here to realize that to
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA90,ESTPc,realize just how much I put everything
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA91,ESTPc,on hold for the hustle for the grind for
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA92,ESTPc,for finding success in my career and I
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA93,ESTPc,would describe like the last couple
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA94,ESTPc,month last two and a half months here
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA95,ESTPc,with all the fun and all the family and
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA96,ESTPc,all this enjoying life it feels like
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA97,ESTPc,rehab but instead of going to rehab to
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA98,ESTPc,overcome an addiction to a substance I
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA99,ESTPc,like I'm in rehab to overcome an
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA100,ESTPc,addiction to work I don't know that I've
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA101,ESTPc,completely overcome my addiction to work
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA102,ESTPc,I definitely haven't I haven't overcome
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA103,ESTPc,the passion that I have to to make
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA104,ESTPc,things but taking these couple of months
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA105,ESTPc,in this huge life change just to sort of
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA106,ESTPc,take inventory on in my life and what my
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA107,ESTPc,life is and what my priorities are
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA108,ESTPc,there's been a couple of big takeaways
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA109,ESTPc,[Music]
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA110,ESTPc,I've always been aware of how amazing
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA111,ESTPc,life is of how amazing my family is and
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA112,ESTPc,how amazing that I'm a healthy person
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA113,ESTPc,and how amazing that I get to do what I
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA114,ESTPc,do for a living none of that's ever been
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA115,ESTPc,lost on me but there's been this weird
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA116,ESTPc,emotional reaction to it and Candace
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA117,ESTPc,calls it I think it's Candace told me
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA118,ESTPc,this but impostor syndrome imposter
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA119,ESTPc,syndrome can be defined as a collection
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA120,ESTPc,of feelings of inadequacy that persist
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA121,ESTPc,despite evident success Impostors suffer
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA122,ESTPc,from chronic self-doubt in a sense of
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA123,ESTPc,intellectual fraudulence that override
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA124,ESTPc,any feeling of success or external proof
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA125,ESTPc,of their competence I think that's a
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA126,ESTPc,little extreme I guess what I'm trying
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA127,ESTPc,to say is like I'm happy and I'm
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA128,ESTPc,fortunate and I'm thankful for this life
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA129,ESTPc,that I get to live hitting this hard
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA130,ESTPc,reset of moving across the country of
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA131,ESTPc,taking a moment not to work and enjoy my
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA132,ESTPc,life and the people that I love has has
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA133,ESTPc,forced me to sort of reconsider how I
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA134,ESTPc,live my life and what my priorities are
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA135,ESTPc,so with that moving ahead I'm putting my
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA136,ESTPc,family and my health and all those kinds
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA137,ESTPc,of things those are now my number one
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA138,ESTPc,and it's a promise I made to myself and
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA139,ESTPc,something that I want to maintain I'm
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA140,ESTPc,still going to make youtube videos and
ESTPc_MY LiFE iN LA141,ESTPc,if I make too many videos please put in

ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!65,ENFJ,11.6 I can really see myself loving this gadget because if you're someone like me that's always on the go
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!66,ENFJ,And you just need something easy and light and portable to you know weigh your stuff. I think this is a good gadget
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!67,ENFJ,This next gadget is for all of my sleepy heads. This is what you call the ostrich pillow now
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!68,ENFJ,This is really cool because it was actually a Kickstarter from studio banana things and pretty much what it is
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!69,ENFJ,"It's an on-the-go sleeping device. How cool is that we're gonna open it up, so opening it up. It looks a little something like this"
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!70,ENFJ,Oh interesting I like the material it's pretty nice. It's not like foamy
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!71,ENFJ,It's more of what would you call this? beady according to Dennis
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!72,ENFJ,This is beady and there are three different ways on how to wear this
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!73,ENFJ,Way number one
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!74,ENFJ,The way number two
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!75,ENFJ,"Like this and style number three is like this, so we're gonna try these out right over here"
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!76,ENFJ,I'll tell you guys how this is so one Pro that this has is you guys will know that usually in airports?
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!77,ENFJ,It's uncomfortable
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!78,ENFJ,There is no where to like lay down the seats are crammed and then sometimes you just wanna lay on your head
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!79,ENFJ,So this is gonna help you do this. Let's go to sleep
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!80,ENFJ,This is kind of nice. This is good because not only is it covering your eyes. It's also comfy
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!81,ENFJ,It's like a nice pillow
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!82,ENFJ,"The only thing that would worry me about this is being at an airport and having some people, maybe like take my stuff"
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!83,ENFJ,"I don't know am I thinking to cruel? this kind of inhibits the fact that you can't really see what's happening around you, so"
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!84,ENFJ,Comfort wise I think this is super comfortable except if you're a girl like me who maybe you're going somewhere
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!85,ENFJ,And you have makeup on I feel like this is probably just taking away all the makeup that I have on and it looks kind
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!86,ENFJ,Of funny like for sure you'll get some stares. I'm sure but it's nice. I like the fact that you can't see any light
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!87,ENFJ,The second way is like this right so now
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!88,ENFJ,We're pretending that I'm in the actual airplane if you're already on the plane. You know that's very uncomfortable
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!89,ENFJ,You're pretty tight with people if you're gonna be kind of uncomfortable like if you're trying to sit this way or sleep
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!90,ENFJ,"This way it's just like it's not the best positioning, right"
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!91,ENFJ,But if you have this you can literally just balance your neck right here
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!92,ENFJ,I mean this kind of works the same way as traditional airplane pillows
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!93,ENFJ,But it has three different functions in case you're sitting with someone a little bit too close
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!94,ENFJ,then you just don't know which way to go you can just kinda go like this
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!95,ENFJ,And then the last one? the last one is
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!96,ENFJ,This is the one that I find to be the funniest
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!97,ENFJ,Kind of like a headband or something like that you got going on. Oh this looks like a cool hat
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!98,ENFJ,I mean it's kinda cool. Imagine if the person next to you and the person this way had one
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!99,ENFJ,"Just like this, and then we could all sleep like this"
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!100,ENFJ,Something really cool that I just noticed about this is you can adjust this in case you got a bigger head there you go or
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!101,ENFJ,tighten it up like that
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!102,ENFJ,I don't know about you
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!103,ENFJ,But every time I travel I find myself creating this huge list of just things that I need it's literally a bunch of post-its all
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!104,ENFJ,"Over my house, just like take your wallet. Take your credit cards"
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!105,ENFJ,Take this take money take cash take your medicine
ENFJ_Best Travel Gadgets EVERY Person Should Know!106,ENFJ,Not anymore honey now all you need is this so I thought this was super cute

ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete1,ENFJc,the multiple sport athlete and why you
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete2,ENFJc,should be a multi-sport athlete when I
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete3,ENFJc,was growing up I was playing multiple
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete4,ENFJc,sports I was playing all kinds of sports

ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete14,ENFJc,bodyweight course string sports that
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete15,ENFJc,really helped me like the boxing I
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete16,ENFJc,noticed that I was stronger than all the
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete17,ENFJc,other kids I was more athletic than all
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete18,ENFJc,the other kids and I know genetics has a
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete19,ENFJc,lot to do with it but I firmly believe
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete20,ENFJc,the more sports that you're playing in
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete21,ENFJc,the younger age the more motor skills
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete22,ENFJc,you're learning okay the more
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete23,ENFJc,athleticism is going to develop okay if
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete24,ENFJc,I'm just playing one sport you're not
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete25,ENFJc,going to develop and and all these
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete26,ENFJc,athletic qualities okay strength being
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete27,ENFJc,the number one athletic quality that is
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete28,ENFJc,the basis for all other activities and
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete29,ENFJc,sports okay I have to have strength to
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete30,ENFJc,have power okay

ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete32,ENFJc,Springs is speed strength which is power
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete33,ENFJc,okay if I don't have that base level
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete34,ENFJc,strength I'm not going to have the power
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete35,ENFJc,which is the explosion on the field okay
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete36,ENFJc,so saying that you need to be doing
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete37,ENFJc,these other sports you need to be
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete38,ENFJc,playing all these other sports if you're
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete39,ENFJc,just a one sport athlete you're gonna be
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete40,ENFJc,behind the eight ball now for me you
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete41,ENFJc,know once I hit 15 to 16 years old I had
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete42,ENFJc,quit all those sports
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete43,ENFJc,I had just focused on baseball that was
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete44,ENFJc,what I wanted to do I was a d1 prospect
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete45,ENFJc,and I was like hey I'm gonna maximize my
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete46,ENFJc,potential as a baseball player well
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete47,ENFJc,here's a newsflash when you're 16 years
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete48,ENFJc,old
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete49,ENFJc,you might not know everything that
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete50,ENFJc,you're doing you might not be right okay
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete51,ENFJc,so I'm busting my butt in the weight
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete52,ENFJc,room I'm getting as strong as can be
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete53,ENFJc,okay
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete54,ENFJc,18 year old and my 18 year old year
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete55,ENFJc,comes around I'm senior in high school
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete56,ENFJc,I've already got my commitment to South
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete57,ENFJc,Alabama go Jags and I'm playing I'm
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete58,ENFJc,hitting BP in front of some pro scouts a
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete59,ENFJc,couple months before draft time there's
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete60,ENFJc,some guys that might be interested in me
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete61,ENFJc,I take a hack boom I break my back I
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete62,ENFJc,break my fracture my l4 l5 and s1 in my
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete63,ENFJc,lower back the pars bones
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete64,ENFJc,there's some ligaments and muscles
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete65,ENFJc,surrounding my lower back and ends up
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete66,ENFJc,putting me out for 22 months through
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete67,ENFJc,into my college career and then I played
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete68,ENFJc,another year or two with my back and all
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete69,ENFJc,these other issues and these problems
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete70,ENFJc,that that back injury caused me because
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete71,ENFJc,I had to I had no choice so I firmly
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete72,ENFJc,believe now to this day that if I would
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete73,ENFJc,have focused on being a multiple sport
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete74,ENFJc,athlete longer but would have done a
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete75,ENFJc,little longer into my career in high
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete76,ENFJc,school it would have not only developed
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete77,ENFJc,me more athletically even though I was
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete78,ENFJc,already a really good athlete but it
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete79,ENFJc,also would have helped me prevent
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete80,ENFJc,focusing on one side of the body with
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete81,ENFJc,the constant rotation that baseball
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete82,ENFJc,happens from the throwing and the
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete83,ENFJc,hitting on that one side okay that one
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete84,ENFJc,side turn into creating the fractures in
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete85,ENFJc,my back and so you're trying to prevent
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete86,ENFJc,injury in the long run even though you
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete87,ENFJc,might not think if I play multiple
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete88,ENFJc,sports but you're developing those
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete89,ENFJc,athletic qualities so take it from me
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete90,ENFJc,learn from me don't be that guy that
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete91,ENFJc,just focuses on once more because it
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete92,ENFJc,could all spend lead to injury and and
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete93,ENFJc,injuries if you look at the statistics
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete94,ENFJc,the injuries are a lot higher for the
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete95,ENFJc,people that are focusing on once more
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete96,ENFJc,year-round now saying that if you look
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete97,ENFJc,at color scouts they love multi-sport
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete98,ENFJc,athletes okay they love the athleticism
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete99,ENFJc,that they provide and even though I was
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete100,ENFJc,a multi-sport athlete I kind of quit a
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete101,ENFJc,little early on those other sports at 15
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete102,ENFJc,years old maybe it would have helped me
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete103,ENFJc,a little bit better maybe I would have
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete104,ENFJc,been healthier once I got to college so
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete105,ENFJc,with I'm a senior in high school and I'm
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete106,ENFJc,playing multiple sports that's gonna be
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete107,ENFJc,more attractive to college baseball
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete108,ENFJc,scouts because of that lettuce is Mbeki
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete109,ENFJc,being able to learn from multiple
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete110,ENFJc,coaches and having that that drive and
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete111,ENFJc,that humbleness that you get from
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete112,ENFJc,playing for them under different coaches
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete113,ENFJc,so here's the thing is if you are one
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete114,ENFJc,sport athlete you better be busting your
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete115,ENFJc,butt in the weight room and I'm not
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete116,ENFJc,talking about lifting by yourself it
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete117,ENFJc,just it makes me laugh when I hear kids
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete118,ENFJc,say it I'm gonna lift by myself this
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete119,ENFJc,offseason you don't know what you're
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete120,ENFJc,doing okay unless your father or less
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete121,ENFJc,your mother your parents have a
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete122,ENFJc,background and strength and conditioning
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete123,ENFJc,you're just going in there to lift okay
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete124,ENFJc,you're just lifting you're looking at
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete125,ENFJc,the mirror and lifting body parts I mean
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete126,ENFJc,if you don't know what the posterior
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete127,ENFJc,chain is it
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete128,ENFJc,don't know that your training movements
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete129,ENFJc,as an athlete not muscles as an athlete
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete130,ENFJc,you need a string coach that knows what
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete131,ENFJc,he's doing
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete132,ENFJc,not some guy that watch DVD and is
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete133,ENFJc,implementing strength training workouts
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete134,ENFJc,someone that actually has the education
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete135,ENFJc,and has been under the bar has the
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete136,ENFJc,training to work with athletes okay if
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete137,ENFJc,you're not doing that you're going to
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete138,ENFJc,increase your risk of injury because
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete139,ENFJc,again you're just going in the weight
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete140,ENFJc,room and you're just doing conventional
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete141,ENFJc,wisdom exercises like Franklin's
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete142,ENFJc,benchpress for a baseball player which
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete143,ENFJc,is horrible for baseball players you
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete144,ENFJc,need to be doing a variation of those
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete145,ENFJc,exercises so if you don't have a string
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete146,ENFJc,coach and you're just lifted on your own
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete147,ENFJc,that's something you need to think about
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete148,ENFJc,okay and if your are one sport athlete
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete149,ENFJc,you need to be doing that string coat
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete150,ENFJc,you need to be working that strength
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete151,ENFJc,training and having a strength coach to
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete152,ENFJc,prevent those injuries okay I was in
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete153,ENFJc,high school I was lifting the whole time
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete154,ENFJc,I was getting strong the problem was is
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete155,ENFJc,I didn't know
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete156,ENFJc,low back Syrio chain I wasn't working my
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete157,ENFJc,backside like I should have been doing
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete158,ENFJc,that ultimately also led to that injury
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete159,ENFJc,so if I'm sitting there I'm looking
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete160,ENFJc,versus a multi-sport athlete versus a
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete161,ENFJc,one sport athlete those are some some of
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete162,ENFJc,the criteria I'm looking at and I'm
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete163,ENFJc,seeing when it comes to the development
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete164,ENFJc,now lastly the biggest thing about
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete165,ENFJc,multiple sword athletes is that the
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete166,ENFJc,younger ages okay I see these young kids
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete167,ENFJc,alright we're focusing on drills of
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete168,ENFJc,whether it's baseball instruction or
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete169,ENFJc,strength training the guys that are
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete170,ENFJc,playing these multiple sports are so far
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete171,ENFJc,more developed and ahead of the guys
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete172,ENFJc,that are one sport athletes when it
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete173,ENFJc,comes to the strength when it comes to
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete174,ENFJc,the speed when it comes to the
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete175,ENFJc,bodyweight exercises when it comes to
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete176,ENFJc,being able to perform drills whether
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete177,ENFJc,it's a hitting drill or a pitching drill
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete178,ENFJc,they have the core stability in the
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete179,ENFJc,strength that those once we're athletes
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete180,ENFJc,don't because those once more athletes
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete181,ENFJc,spend nine months out of the year doing
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete182,ENFJc,nothing okay they're not focusing on
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete183,ENFJc,these other sports they're not focused
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete184,ENFJc,on developing all these other athletic
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete185,ENFJc,qualities and that right there put you
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete186,ENFJc,behind the eight-ball immediately you
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete187,ENFJc,know you're six to 12 years old and
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete188,ENFJc,you're only focusing on one sport those
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete189,ENFJc,guys that are playing those other sports
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete190,ENFJc,they're gonna continue to get better and
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete191,ENFJc,better and better than you unless you
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete192,ENFJc,are physically gifted genetically
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete193,ENFJc,they're gonna continue to get better to
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete194,ENFJc,you and they're gonna be way ahead
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete195,ENFJc,for the long run so keep this in mind
ENFJc_One-Sport Athlete vs Multi-Sport Athlete196,ENFJc,okay multi-sport athletes versus one

ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes1,ENTPc,overtime athletes so for this video what
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes2,ENTPc,I wanted to address was how to program
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes3,ENTPc,lower body auxiliaries or supplemental
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes4,ENTPc,strength exercises for power for speed
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes5,ENTPc,for the power athlete right now there's
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes6,ENTPc,many ways to skin a cat and there's
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes7,ENTPc,probably other ways that some other
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes8,ENTPc,coaches do it but just to keep things
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes9,ENTPc,basic and simple if you're designing
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes10,ENTPc,your own program and you want to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes11,ENTPc,essentially make sure that you're
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes12,ENTPc,checking all the boxes to be able to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes13,ENTPc,continue to produce strength and power
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes14,ENTPc,out of your lower body this was the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes15,ENTPc,video that I want to make for you guys
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes16,ENTPc,so just start from a day-by-day or micro
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes17,ENTPc,cycle meaning looking at a lower body
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes18,ENTPc,workout right you usually have your
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes19,ENTPc,speed your power movements then I'll get
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes20,ENTPc,into my compound lift my main lift for
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes21,ENTPc,that day right whether that be a trap
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes22,ENTPc,bar deadlift or a back squat and then
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes23,ENTPc,what I'm talking about is that is the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes24,ENTPc,accessory movements that essentially
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes25,ENTPc,supplement that now sometimes this is
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes26,ENTPc,commonly overlooked what I like to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes27,ENTPc,preach to my guys especially when I'm
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes28,ENTPc,administering the program here inside my
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes29,ENTPc,gym one thing that I shift our guys are
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes30,ENTPc,have a paradigm shift for our athletes
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes31,ENTPc,is don't just go through the motions on
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes32,ENTPc,your accessory lifts you want to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes33,ENTPc,approach them with the same intensity
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes34,ENTPc,that you do your compound lifts ok so
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes35,ENTPc,even though it's 8 repetitions 10
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes36,ENTPc,repetitions for that particular lift I
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes37,ENTPc,still want you to approach it like
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes38,ENTPc,you're doing that 1 rep max now that
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes39,ENTPc,doesn't mean two fold out I mean you're
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes40,ENTPc,still technical maintain technique form
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes41,ENTPc,things of that nature but I tell my guys
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes42,ENTPc,think about growing from your
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes43,ENTPc,auxiliaries think about getting stronger
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes44,ENTPc,from your auxiliaries not just your
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes45,ENTPc,compound lifts and when you approach it
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes46,ENTPc,with that intensity
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes47,ENTPc,you can really start to see you gain
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes48,ENTPc,traction as far as your strength as far
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes49,ENTPc,as your power as far as your speed now
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes50,ENTPc,to get into how I program them once
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes51,ENTPc,we've done that compound movement let's
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes52,ENTPc,say we just did a trap bar deadlift
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes53,ENTPc,depending if I'm loading the spine or
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes54,ENTPc,I'm pulling from the ground is how I'll
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes55,ENTPc,start to determine what exercises I do
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes56,ENTPc,but as far as the actual movement
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes57,ENTPc,patterns
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes58,ENTPc,I'll always start next after I do a
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes59,ENTPc,bilateral I always continue to use the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes60,ENTPc,the mindset of the highest neurological
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes61,ENTPc,demand first so even when it comes to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes62,ENTPc,auxiliaries the highest neurological
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes63,ENTPc,demand typically is your unilateral
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes64,ENTPc,strength movement next so what I like to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes65,ENTPc,do is I like to perform my unilateral
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes66,ENTPc,accessory first and what that means is
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes67,ENTPc,this is going to be your lunges right
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes68,ENTPc,one of my favorites as you guys know
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes69,ENTPc,reverse lunge we could do this weighted
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes70,ENTPc,if I do any form of a step-up
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes71,ENTPc,you know just stepping up to it so
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes72,ENTPc,anything that's single leg and basically
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes73,ENTPc,independently working on that single leg
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes74,ENTPc,I do first
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes75,ENTPc,next after that I'll actually go back to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes76,ENTPc,bilateral which is both feet and I'll
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes77,ENTPc,move into a more hinge movement right so
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes78,ENTPc,now we're working the entire posterior
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes79,ENTPc,chain through the hinge movement so what
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes80,ENTPc,that looks like is that could be a
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes81,ENTPc,barbell RDL this could be a kettlebell
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes82,ENTPc,swing in a more advanced or more
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes83,ENTPc,progressed manner of that but anything
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes84,ENTPc,that we're doing both feet on the ground
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes85,ENTPc,close chain and I'm doing a bilateral
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes86,ENTPc,movement now it's not the safer hinge I
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes87,ENTPc,won't go single leg like a single leg
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes88,ENTPc,RDL but for the most part what you're
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes89,ENTPc,thinking here is some form of a lunge
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes90,ENTPc,pattern right some form of that even a
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes91,ENTPc,heavy sled March basically anything in
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes92,ENTPc,that unilateral motion still working a
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes93,ENTPc,lot of the posterior chain and then
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes94,ENTPc,moving to that hinge pattern right after
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes95,ENTPc,that depending remember
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes96,ENTPc,usually do two days of lower-body a week
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes97,ENTPc,I'll either do I'll either move to a
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes98,ENTPc,more comp continue compound lift in the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes99,ENTPc,in this lateral plane where I might do
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes100,ENTPc,some form of a lateral lunge there's
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes101,ENTPc,other movements so we can progress
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes102,ENTPc,through that and then on the second day
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes103,ENTPc,what I'll do is I might do some work
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes104,ENTPc,across the knee where I'm working the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes105,ENTPc,hamstrings directly or I might do some
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes106,ENTPc,things across the hip where I'm working
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes107,ENTPc,the glutes directly right because I like
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes108,ENTPc,to touch those each time as well where
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes109,ENTPc,it's in the it's in the form of you know
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes110,ENTPc,I'm isolating and trying to elevate that
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes111,ENTPc,muscle and that just depends on the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes112,ENTPc,athlete and where they're at in the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes113,ENTPc,program now as far as programming them
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes114,ENTPc,as far as progression I always tell you
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes115,ENTPc,guys think of it as in phases right so
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes116,ENTPc,when I start off with these movements
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes117,ENTPc,I'm gonna try to establish them in the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes118,ENTPc,most basic motor qualities with the most
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes119,ENTPc,basic variation that there is possible
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes120,ENTPc,so for instance let's take the the lunge
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes121,ENTPc,the reverse lunge is one of my favorite
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes122,ENTPc,move is for unilateral so what I'll
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes123,ENTPc,start with is let's say with just
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes124,ENTPc,regular dumbbells the you know on a flat
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes125,ENTPc,surface doing a dumbbell reverse lunge
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes126,ENTPc,boom getting that range and coming back
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes127,ENTPc,up I might progress that to a elevated
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes128,ENTPc,reverse lunge doing the same thing so by
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes129,ENTPc,progressing to this now by coming on a
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes130,ENTPc,box I've actually deepen the range of
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes131,ENTPc,motion right so I'm actually just sink
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes132,ENTPc,down deeper creating a bigger range of
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes133,ENTPc,motion for my muscles to essentially go
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes134,ENTPc,through from there I might go ahead and
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes135,ENTPc,go axial load then right so I go now
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes136,ENTPc,move to axial load where I'm loading the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes137,ENTPc,spine and by doing that I have to be
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes138,ENTPc,able to transfer energy through my torso
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes139,ENTPc,for myself to be able to support that
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes140,ENTPc,weight on my back okay and then from
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes141,ENTPc,there I could go from barbell to box
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes142,ENTPc,right and then from barbell to maybe
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes143,ENTPc,bands accommodating resistance and do it
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes144,ENTPc,fast-tempo each block I'm trying to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes145,ENTPc,progress and throw some form of
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes146,ENTPc,variation where I can continue to
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes147,ENTPc,elevate that athlete and throw variation
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes148,ENTPc,for him to excel at or her to excel at
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes149,ENTPc,that's pretty much it how I program
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes150,ENTPc,auxiliaries I can't say this enough the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes151,ENTPc,first thing I said and the first thing I
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes152,ENTPc,wanted address in this video is how you
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes153,ENTPc,approach your accessories make sure that
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes154,ENTPc,you're coming with the utmost intensity
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes155,ENTPc,as I tell my guys in here I tell my
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes156,ENTPc,athletes as well you grow through the
ENTPc_How to Program Lower Body Exercises for Performance | Overtime Athletes157,ENTPc,accessories alright you grow and you get

INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries1,INFJ,"I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine: Mr. Wilson."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries2,INFJ,(Laughter)
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries3,INFJ,"No, not Russell Wilson from the Seahawks."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries4,INFJ,"He plays with this oblong ball,
and it doesn't bounce very well."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries5,INFJ,"But Mr. Wilson and I
have been friends for a long time."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries6,INFJ,"We go way back,
and he's been by my -- I mean,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries7,INFJ,"I first met him when I was --
at Christmas time."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries8,INFJ,"I was about four years old,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries9,INFJ,"and there was this big box
in front of the Christmas tree,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries10,INFJ,"and I just dove in and opened it up,
and there was this big orange ball."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries11,INFJ,And he's been by my side ever since.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries12,INFJ,"When I walked down the street
or went to school,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries13,INFJ,I always had Mr. Wilson with me.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries14,INFJ,"And then I went on to college
and obviously played college basketball."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries15,INFJ,"Then I went on
to play professional basketball,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries16,INFJ,"and he's been actually a part of my life
in my business career."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries17,INFJ,"So we've been on this journey
for a long time,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries18,INFJ,and it's been an interesting journey.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries19,INFJ,"And one of the things
that we've been able to do"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries20,INFJ,is meet some amazing people.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries21,INFJ,Those amazing people are elite athletes;
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries22,INFJ,"not just your regular athletes
but your elite athletes."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries23,INFJ,"Now, a lot of you are going to say,
""I can't relate to these people."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries24,INFJ,"""They're superhuman, these men and women."""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries25,INFJ,"I'll give you a little secret:
they're just like you and me."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries26,INFJ,I actually had a front row seat.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries27,INFJ,"OK, I was at the end of the bench,
watching, and observing, and learning"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries28,INFJ,"from these world-class 
amazing kind of athletes."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries29,INFJ,"But what I want to give you today
is a window into that world"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries30,INFJ,"that a lot of us
don't have an opportunity to."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries31,INFJ,"And a lot of us think
that these amazing athletes"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries32,INFJ,"are there because of their talent,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries33,INFJ,"but Mr. Wilson and I realized
it's really not."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries34,INFJ,It's about a competitive mindset.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries35,INFJ,"They actually see, and think, and behave
so much different than we do."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries36,INFJ,"And that's what I want to share with you:
some two key points that we saw"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries37,INFJ,"that maybe you could use
in your daily life or in your business."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries38,INFJ,"The two points are visualization
and deliberate practice."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries39,INFJ,Let's start with visualization.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries40,INFJ,"A lot of us think that visualization
is about seeing a goal ahead of us."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries41,INFJ,But actually these people travel in time.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries42,INFJ,"They actually take 
their emotions, their senses"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries43,INFJ,"- seeing, hearing, touching -
and they go into the future."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries44,INFJ,"What they're doing is defining
their own reality, their own future,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries45,INFJ,and they're living there.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries46,INFJ,"And then they come back,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries47,INFJ,"and then they have already
created an imprint,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries48,INFJ,"a blueprint of what success
is going to be for them."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries49,INFJ,Let me give you an example.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries50,INFJ,"I used to be a really good shooter,
and I used to shoot a lot of free throws."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries51,INFJ,"Before I shot a free throw,
I would actually--"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries52,INFJ,"- and you can take the time
if you want to follow with me -"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries53,INFJ,"is close your eyes, and I would think
about how I was holding the ball,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries54,INFJ,"I would think about the arc of the ball,
I would think of a really good backspin,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries55,INFJ,and it goes right through the net.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries56,INFJ,And what was really cool to me
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries57,INFJ,"if I could make the net 
flip up onto the rim."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries58,INFJ,"Then all I would do was open my eyes,
take a couple dribbles,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries59,INFJ,and I would just let it go.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries60,INFJ,"Nine out of ten times, 
I would make it, 90% of the time."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries61,INFJ,"What I didn't realize at that time
was with neuroscience today"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries62,INFJ,"when you actually visualize
what I was doing,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries63,INFJ,"you're actually using the same part
of the brain as if you were doing it."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries64,INFJ,And it's so powerful today.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries65,INFJ,"Even Jordan Spieth, 
the number-one golfer in the world,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries66,INFJ,"you've probably heard now with technology
their communication with him."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries67,INFJ,"Michael Geller would say
to Jordan Spieth, ""Paint a picture."""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries68,INFJ,"Well, what he's saying is,
""Look at the flight of the ball."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries69,INFJ,"Watch it hit the green;
watch it roll onto the green."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries70,INFJ,"How is it going to react?"""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries71,INFJ,"Jordan would say, ""Got it,"" and he says,
""Make it happen,"" and so he does."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries72,INFJ,"One of the most powerful one 
of these visualizations"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries73,INFJ,"happened with a gentleman
named Colonel Nesmeth."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries74,INFJ,"He was an average golfer,
shot around 95."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries75,INFJ,"But something happened
in his life, tragically."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries76,INFJ,"He became a prisoner of war
during the Vietnam War."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries77,INFJ,"He was a prisoner 
for seven and a half years"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries78,INFJ,in a solitary confinement
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries79,INFJ,"of a cell no more 
than 5 feet by 5 feet by 5 feet."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries80,INFJ,"What would you do
if you were in that situation?"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries81,INFJ,"Well, he didn't want to give up hope."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries82,INFJ,"He wanted to overcome this,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries83,INFJ,so what he did is he actually played golf.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries84,INFJ,"He didn't think about golf;
he was actually playing golf."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries85,INFJ,He visualized it.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries86,INFJ,"So what he would do for four hours
is play his golf course back home."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries87,INFJ,He would put a tee in the ground.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries88,INFJ,"He would hit it,
watch it go down the fairway,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries89,INFJ,"put the club back into the bag,
and start walking down the fairway."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries90,INFJ,He would hear the birds.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries91,INFJ,He would hear the clippers of the mowers.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries92,INFJ,"He would feel the wind on his back,
and he would keep on walking along."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries93,INFJ,"He would come up to his ball,
and he would repeat it again,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries94,INFJ,and he would feel the club in his hands.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries95,INFJ,"At the end of seven and half years,
he was finally released."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries96,INFJ,But he did this every day.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries97,INFJ,"Now remember I said 
that he had a shot around a 95."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries98,INFJ,"That was his handicap, or his strokes."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries99,INFJ,What do you think he did when he came back
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries100,INFJ,"after not touching a club 
for seven and a half years?"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries101,INFJ,"You would think he would at least
shoot a 95, but probably higher."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries102,INFJ,"The amazing thing is, he shot a 75,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries103,INFJ,"20 strokes less than what he did,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries104,INFJ,by just doing visualization.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries105,INFJ,"This is a more powerful tool
that we can use in our daily lives."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries106,INFJ,"If you're a sales rep,
visualize your sales presentation."

INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries109,INFJ,How many of you want to lose weight?
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries110,INFJ,A lot of us want to lose weight.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries111,INFJ,"Visualize what you're going to look like
when you lose your weight."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries112,INFJ,"Put on the dress,
see yourself in the mirror."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries113,INFJ,"eat the food that you need to do,"

you've already created an imprint"

INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries118,INFJ,"The second thing I want to talk about is
we all want to be successful."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries119,INFJ,"But nothing cripples success
or performance than damaged confidence."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries120,INFJ,"So we see these athletes
as being super confident"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries121,INFJ,"because of their talent, right?"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries122,INFJ,But it's not.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries123,INFJ,"There was a study in the UK
that was extensive,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries124,INFJ,"and determined innate gifts
do not determine success."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries125,INFJ,So then what's going on?
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries126,INFJ,It's hard work.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries127,INFJ,"No, it's not just hard work,
it's specific hard work."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries128,INFJ,"And that was discovered
by Anders Ericsson"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries129,INFJ,from Florida State University.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries130,INFJ,"And he did a groundbreaking study

by Anders Ericsson?"

just beyond one's level of competence."""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries135,INFJ,"There's four tenets that I want
to share with you today."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries136,INFJ,"One of the tenets is:
you have to make it personal,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries137,INFJ,"and you have to base it
upon principles of fundamentals."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries138,INFJ,"A lot of us would practice
shooting free throws"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries139,INFJ,"by getting on the free throw line
and doing it many, many times."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries140,INFJ,What deliberate practice is
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries141,INFJ,"is using something
in your fundamentals to build upon."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries142,INFJ,"So I would actually go to the front
of the rim and actually shoot straight up,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries143,INFJ,"because I knew arc was 
an important fundamental in shooting."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries144,INFJ,"Then it would come straight down
through the hole, or the hoop."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries145,INFJ,"Did you know that two basketballs
can fit through a hoop at the same time?"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries146,INFJ,That's how big it is.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries147,INFJ,"So one of the tenets is
basically working on something"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries148,INFJ,of your fundamentals and strengths.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries149,INFJ,"Then the next is obviously repetition:
repetition, repetition, repetition."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries150,INFJ,"So I would do this for 50 times,
and then I would do it 100 times."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries151,INFJ,"But then I would add the third tenet,
which is stretch your abilities."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries152,INFJ,Get out of your comfort zone.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries153,INFJ,"So then what I would do
is then I would have to do it"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries154,INFJ,without the ball touching the rim.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries155,INFJ,Think about how hard that could be.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries156,INFJ,"That is what makes 
deliberate practice so difficult,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries157,INFJ,because it's tedious and painful.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries158,INFJ,"But if you do it, you'll be successful
in what you want to accomplish."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries159,INFJ,"The fourth tenet is something
that we naturally should know"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries160,INFJ,"but we don't;
that is you need feedback."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries161,INFJ,"How are you going to improve
without beginning the feedback?"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries162,INFJ,"A lot of us do things on our own,
but guess what?"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries163,INFJ,Don't these people have coaches?
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries164,INFJ,"Don't they have people, advisers,
and people looking at them"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries165,INFJ,to give them the feedback that they need?
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries166,INFJ,"So, now after you've seen
deliberate practice,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries167,INFJ,"it kind of makes sense
why they are so confident in what they do."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries168,INFJ,"Now, it's not what they do"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries169,INFJ,"or who they are, but it's how they do it."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries170,INFJ,So the refresh is use visualization.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries171,INFJ,"That is the ability to create
a new reality for yourself,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries172,INFJ,"determine it, live there 
constantly, and come back."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries173,INFJ,"And then your choices 
and your decisions are all based upon"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries174,INFJ,what you have just determined.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries175,INFJ,The other is deliberate practice.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries176,INFJ,"And deliberate practice,
you have to work on fundamentals,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries177,INFJ,"and you have to work on
the right fundamentals."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries178,INFJ,"The next step after that is basically,
""Am I building upon those fundamentals?"""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries179,INFJ,"And a lot of us know 
what we're supposed to do,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries180,INFJ,but we don't do it.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries181,INFJ,"And the third part is:
this is a journey for these people."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries182,INFJ,It's a constant progression in life.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries183,INFJ,"And they're always asking
one simple question,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries184,INFJ,"""Am I doing everything I possibly can?"""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries185,INFJ,"Because they never stop;
it's a journey for them."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries186,INFJ,"So they're always breaking down
new barriers."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries187,INFJ,"They're always creating
new challenges for themselves."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries188,INFJ,They're always about winning.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries189,INFJ,"And a lot of people say,
""Winning? Oh, my gosh."""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries190,INFJ,"No, it's not about 
vanquishing an opponent."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries191,INFJ,"It's about their way of ability
to measure or benchmark"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries192,INFJ,"where they are in this process,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries193,INFJ,"And it's a process to them,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries194,INFJ,so failure is not a killer to them.
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries195,INFJ,"John Wooden once said,"
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries196,INFJ,"""Failure is not fatal,
but failure to change can be."""
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries197,INFJ,"So this is a journey that they've been on
and are continually going."
INFJ_Secrets of elite athletes | Kenn Dickinson | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries198,INFJ,"Now, there's a lady that inspired me,
and it was a tremendous story."

"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein1",ESTPc,"Faster, Higher, Stronger."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein2",ESTPc,And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein3",ESTPc,The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon

"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein13",ESTPc,So what's going on here?
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein14",ESTPc,I want to take a look at what's really behind
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein15",ESTPc,this march of athletic progress.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein16",ESTPc,"In 1936, Jesse Owens"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein17",ESTPc,held the world record in the 100 meters.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein18",ESTPc,Had Jesse Owens been racing last year
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein19",ESTPc,"in the world championships of the 100 meters,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein20",ESTPc,"when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein21",ESTPc,Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein22",ESTPc,That's a lot in sprinter land.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein23",ESTPc,"To give you a sense of how much it is,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein24",ESTPc,I want to share with you a demonstration
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein25",ESTPc,conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein26",ESTPc,Now picture the stadium last year
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein27",ESTPc,at the world championships of the 100 meters:
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein28",ESTPc,thousands of fans waiting with baited breath
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein29",ESTPc,"to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein30",ESTPc,"flashbulbs popping as the
nine fastest men in the world"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein31",ESTPc,coil themselves into their blocks.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein32",ESTPc,And I want you to pretend
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein33",ESTPc,that Jesse Owens is in that race.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein34",ESTPc,"Now close your eyes for a
second and picture the race."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein35",ESTPc,Bang! The gun goes off.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein36",ESTPc,An American sprinter jumps out to the front.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein37",ESTPc,Usain Bolt starts to catch him.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein38",ESTPc,"Usain Bolt passes him, and as
the runners come to the finish,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein39",ESTPc,you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein40",ESTPc,(Beeps)
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein41",ESTPc,That's the entire finish of the race.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein42",ESTPc,You can open your eyes now.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein43",ESTPc,That first beep was Usain Bolt.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein44",ESTPc,That last beep was Jesse Owens.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein45",ESTPc,Listen to it again.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein46",ESTPc,(Beeps)
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein47",ESTPc,"When you think of it like that,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein48",ESTPc,"it's not that big a difference, is it?"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein49",ESTPc,And then consider that Usain Bolt started
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein50",ESTPc,by propelling himself out of blocks
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein51",ESTPc,down a specially fabricated carpet
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein52",ESTPc,designed to allow him to travel
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein53",ESTPc,as fast as humanly possible.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein54",ESTPc,"Jesse Owens, on the other hand,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein55",ESTPc,"ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein56",ESTPc,and that soft surface stole far more energy
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein57",ESTPc,from his legs as he ran.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein58",ESTPc,"Rather than blocks, Jesse
Owens had a gardening trowel"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein59",ESTPc,"that he had to use to dig holes
in the cinders to start from."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein60",ESTPc,Biomechanical analysis of the speed
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein61",ESTPc,of Owens' joints shows that had been running
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein62",ESTPc,"on the same surface as Bolt,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein63",ESTPc,"he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein64",ESTPc,he would have been within one stride.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein65",ESTPc,"Rather than the last beep,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein66",ESTPc,Owens would have been the second beep.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein67",ESTPc,Listen to it again.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein68",ESTPc,(Beeps)
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein69",ESTPc,"That's the difference track
surface technology has made,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein70",ESTPc,and it's done it throughout the running world.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein71",ESTPc,Consider a longer event.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein72",ESTPc,"In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein73",ESTPc,"became the first man to run
under four minutes in the mile."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein74",ESTPc,"Nowadays, college kids do that every year."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein75",ESTPc,"On rare occasions, a high school kid does it."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein76",ESTPc,"As of the end of last year,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein77",ESTPc,"1,314 men"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein78",ESTPc,"had run under four minutes in the mile,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein79",ESTPc,"but like Jesse Owens,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein80",ESTPc,Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein81",ESTPc,that stole far more energy from his legs
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein82",ESTPc,than the synthetic tracks of today.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein83",ESTPc,So I consulted biomechanics experts
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein84",ESTPc,to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein85",ESTPc,"than synthetic tracks,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein86",ESTPc,"and their consensus that it's
one and a half percent slower."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein87",ESTPc,"So if you apply a one and a half
percent slowdown conversion"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein88",ESTPc,to every man who ran his sub-four mile
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein89",ESTPc,"on a synthetic track,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein90",ESTPc,this is what happens.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein91",ESTPc,Only 530 are left.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein92",ESTPc,"If you look at it from that perspective,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein93",ESTPc,fewer than ten new men per [year]
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein94",ESTPc,have joined the sub-four mile club
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein95",ESTPc,since Sir Roger Bannister.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein96",ESTPc,"Now, 530 is a lot more than one,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein97",ESTPc,"and that's partly because
there are many more people"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein98",ESTPc,training today and they're training more intelligently.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein99",ESTPc,Even college kids are professional in their training
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein100",ESTPc,"compared to Sir Roger Bannister,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein101",ESTPc,who trained for 45 minutes at a time
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein102",ESTPc,while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein103",ESTPc,And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein104",ESTPc,"in three in a half hours,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein105",ESTPc,that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy

"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein107",ESTPc,That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein108",ESTPc,(Laughter)
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein109",ESTPc,"Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein110",ESTPc,"about performance-enhancing drugs as well,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein111",ESTPc,"and that's made a difference
in some sports at some times,"

"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein119",ESTPc,"Rather than stopping and turning around,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein120",ESTPc,athletes could somersault under the water

"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein132",ESTPc,for the longest distance cycled in one hour
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein133",ESTPc,"at 30 miles, 3,774 feet."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein134",ESTPc,Now that record improved and improved
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein135",ESTPc,as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein136",ESTPc,"all the way until 1996,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein137",ESTPc,"when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein138",ESTPc,nearly five miles farther
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein139",ESTPc,than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein140",ESTPc,"But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein141",ESTPc,decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein142",ESTPc,had to do so with essentially the same equipment
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein143",ESTPc,that Eddy Merckx used in 1972.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein144",ESTPc,Where does the record stand today?
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein145",ESTPc,"30 miles, 4,657 feet,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein146",ESTPc,a grand total of 883 feet
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein147",ESTPc,farther than Eddy Merckx cycled
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein148",ESTPc,more than four decades ago.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein149",ESTPc,Essentially the entire improvement in this record
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein150",ESTPc,was due to technology.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein151",ESTPc,"Still, technology isn't the only
thing pushing athletes forward."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein152",ESTPc,While indeed we haven't evolved
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein153",ESTPc,"into a new species in a century,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein154",ESTPc,the gene pool within competitive sports
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein155",ESTPc,most certainly has changed.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein156",ESTPc,"In the early half of the 20th century,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein157",ESTPc,physical education instructors and coaches
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein158",ESTPc,had the idea that the average body type
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein159",ESTPc,was the best for all athletic endeavors:
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein160",ESTPc,"medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein161",ESTPc,And this showed in athletes' bodies.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein162",ESTPc,"In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein163",ESTPc,"and average elite shot-putter
were the same exact size."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein164",ESTPc,"But as that idea started to fade away,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein165",ESTPc,as sports scientists and coaches realized that
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein166",ESTPc,"rather than the average body type,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein167",ESTPc,you want highly specialized bodies
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein168",ESTPc,"that fit into certain athletic niches,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein169",ESTPc,"a form of artificial selection took place,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein170",ESTPc,"a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein171",ESTPc,"and athletes' bodies became
more different from one another."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein172",ESTPc,"Today, rather than the same size
as the average elite high jumper,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein173",ESTPc,the average elite shot-putter
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein174",ESTPc,is two and a half inches taller
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein175",ESTPc,and 130 pounds heavier.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein176",ESTPc,And this happened throughout the sports world.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein177",ESTPc,"In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein178",ESTPc,one data point for each of two dozen sports
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein179",ESTPc,"in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein180",ESTPc,"There's some dispersal,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein181",ESTPc,"but it's kind of grouped
around that average body type."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein182",ESTPc,"Then that idea started to go away,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein183",ESTPc,"and at the same time, digital technology --"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein184",ESTPc,"first radio, then television and the Internet --"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein185",ESTPc,"gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein186",ESTPc,a ticket to consume elite sports performance.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein187",ESTPc,"The financial incentives and fame and glory
afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein188",ESTPc,"and it tipped toward the tiny
upper echelon of performance."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein189",ESTPc,"It accelerated the artificial
selection for specialized bodies."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein190",ESTPc,And if you plot a data point for these same
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein191",ESTPc,"two dozen sports today, it looks like this."
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein192",ESTPc,The athletes' bodies have gotten
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein193",ESTPc,much more different from one another.
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein194",ESTPc,And because this chart looks like the charts
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein195",ESTPc,"that show the expanding universe,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein196",ESTPc,"with the galaxies flying away from one another,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein197",ESTPc,the scientists who discovered it call it
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein198",ESTPc,"""The Big Bang of Body Types."""
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein199",ESTPc,"In sports where height is prized, like basketball,"
"ESTPc_Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein200",ESTPc,the tall athletes got taller.

ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*91,ENTJ,all the professors that over the past 30
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*92,ENTJ,40 years which professors have graded
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*93,ENTJ,the best on student athletes and which

ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*99,ENTJ,automatic acceptance into the university
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*100,ENTJ,this is kind of like the big deal on how

ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*104,ENTJ,wouldn't have made it in at Texas A&M
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*105,ENTJ,because you had to be like top seven or
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*106,ENTJ,something you're gonna and so I wouldn't
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*107,ENTJ,have been accepted then I went for
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*108,ENTJ,running I probably wouldn't have gone to
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*109,ENTJ,college but it pretty much just opened
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*110,ENTJ,the door and any any school I wanted to
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*111,ENTJ,would automatically accept me in and I

ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*131,ENTJ,would be running against athletes that
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*132,ENTJ,were much better than me and had a lot
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*133,ENTJ,more experience so I had an amazing
ENTJ_Pros and Cons of Being a D1 Athlete *all sports*134,ENTJ,opportunity to learn from them and take

ESTJc_my story20,ESTJc,and I'm just super blessed in that
ESTJc_my story21,ESTJc,aspect of my life because I know a lot
ESTJc_my story22,ESTJc,of people don't have parents look up to
ESTJc_my story23,ESTJc,you for like an example of love and I
ESTJc_my story24,ESTJc,feel like I was really blessed with that
ESTJc_my story25,ESTJc,so I grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana
ESTJc_my story26,ESTJc,until I was in fifth grade and Hurricane
ESTJc_my story27,ESTJc,Katrina hit and my dad his job actually
ESTJc_my story28,ESTJc,moved to Florida so in sixth grade I
ESTJc_my story29,ESTJc,moved to Florida and the summer of fifth
ESTJc_my story30,ESTJc,grade I went to a camp called Pine Cove
ESTJc_my story31,ESTJc,for the first time with some of my
ESTJc_my story32,ESTJc,friends from Louisiana and I think that
ESTJc_my story33,ESTJc,was the first like big monumental
ESTJc_my story34,ESTJc,spiritual step in my life because I had
ESTJc_my story35,ESTJc,grown up in the church I'd heard about
ESTJc_my story36,ESTJc,Jesus and I always considered myself to
ESTJc_my story37,ESTJc,believe in that and be a Christian but
ESTJc_my story38,ESTJc,at that summer camp I decided to
ESTJc_my story39,ESTJc,dedicate my life to God and following
ESTJc_my story40,ESTJc,God and so that that's kind of like the
ESTJc_my story41,ESTJc,first pivotal moment between like me and
ESTJc_my story42,ESTJc,my relationship with God but I look back
ESTJc_my story43,ESTJc,at that and I think it was probably hard
ESTJc_my story44,ESTJc,as a fifth grader to really understand
ESTJc_my story45,ESTJc,all of like the ins and outs of being a
ESTJc_my story46,ESTJc,Christian and following Jesus so I think
ESTJc_my story47,ESTJc,that I my heart was in the right place
ESTJc_my story48,ESTJc,but I don't think I fully understood so
ESTJc_my story49,ESTJc,then moving on to middle school I feel
ESTJc_my story50,ESTJc,like that's when a lot of emotional
ESTJc_my story51,ESTJc,battles started for me because I had
ESTJc_my story52,ESTJc,always been very outgoing I have so many
ESTJc_my story53,ESTJc,great friends surrounding me when I
ESTJc_my story54,ESTJc,lived in Louisiana and when I moved to
ESTJc_my story55,ESTJc,Florida I didn't have that and I think
ESTJc_my story56,ESTJc,that's why I became very introverted and
ESTJc_my story57,ESTJc,shy I don't know I don't have the
ESTJc_my story58,ESTJc,fondest memories of Nicole but I also
ESTJc_my story59,ESTJc,don't think anything like huge happened
ESTJc_my story60,ESTJc,in my life throughout middle school my
ESTJc_my story61,ESTJc,walk with Jesus was just kind of like
ESTJc_my story62,ESTJc,worshiping in Chapel and I didn't really
ESTJc_my story63,ESTJc,think anything else of it then in high
ESTJc_my story64,ESTJc,school that's when things really started
ESTJc_my story65,ESTJc,to get uhm things started to get harder
ESTJc_my story66,ESTJc,I guess you could say I I don't want to
ESTJc_my story67,ESTJc,say anything specific because like I
ESTJc_my story68,ESTJc,don't want to like say anything bad
ESTJc_my story69,ESTJc,about people in my life you know because
ESTJc_my story70,ESTJc,like there's still people out living in
ESTJc_my story71,ESTJc,the world so basically I was in I had
ESTJc_my story72,ESTJc,relationships that were not healthy in
ESTJc_my story73,ESTJc,my life I also was going through a lot
ESTJc_my story74,ESTJc,of stuff because my sophomore year of
ESTJc_my story75,ESTJc,high school my sister and her husband
ESTJc_my story76,ESTJc,moved to Copenhagen Denmark which was
ESTJc_my story77,ESTJc,like the saddest thing of my life
ESTJc_my story78,ESTJc,because my sister is my best friend and
ESTJc_my story79,ESTJc,that was just really hard and for the
ESTJc_my story80,ESTJc,first time in my life a lot of people
ESTJc_my story81,ESTJc,and my family passed away which was very
ESTJc_my story82,ESTJc,strange because usually when you lose a
ESTJc_my story83,ESTJc,family member it's like one person and
ESTJc_my story84,ESTJc,then like it'll wait a long time until
ESTJc_my story85,ESTJc,the next person passes away but in our
ESTJc_my story86,ESTJc,family like in a year and a half period
ESTJc_my story87,ESTJc,we lost four of our family members
ESTJc_my story88,ESTJc,so um two of my uncles my granddad and
ESTJc_my story89,ESTJc,my grandmother all passed away in a very
ESTJc_my story90,ESTJc,short period of time I just kind of
ESTJc_my story91,ESTJc,suppressed everything I remember just
ESTJc_my story92,ESTJc,like never even crying because I was
ESTJc_my story93,ESTJc,just like so like just trying to stay
ESTJc_my story94,ESTJc,strong for my family trying to just stay
ESTJc_my story95,ESTJc,strong for myself and I just kind of
ESTJc_my story96,ESTJc,didn't process anything and
ESTJc_my story97,ESTJc,when I started developing really really
ESTJc_my story98,ESTJc,bad anxiety
ESTJc_my story99,ESTJc,I know anxiety kind of manifests itself
ESTJc_my story100,ESTJc,in different ways and everybody and the
ESTJc_my story101,ESTJc,way it manifested in me was it really
ESTJc_my story102,ESTJc,affected my sleep so I remember it was
ESTJc_my story103,ESTJc,my sophomore year in high school and one
ESTJc_my story104,ESTJc,night I just couldn't fall asleep and it
ESTJc_my story105,ESTJc,was the strangest thing and I remember
ESTJc_my story106,ESTJc,looking at the clock and it was like 4
ESTJc_my story107,ESTJc,o'clock in the morning and I was wide
ESTJc_my story108,ESTJc,awake and I started feeling like panic
ESTJc_my story109,ESTJc,it was like why the heck am I not
ESTJc_my story110,ESTJc,sleeping and it started to making me
ESTJc_my story111,ESTJc,really nervous and that was the first
ESTJc_my story112,ESTJc,night that I just didn't sleep at all
ESTJc_my story113,ESTJc,throughout the whole night and I was
ESTJc_my story114,ESTJc,like well that's so weird and then the
ESTJc_my story115,ESTJc,next day I was like anxious about
ESTJc_my story116,ESTJc,sleeping again
ESTJc_my story117,ESTJc,like the next night and so I was
ESTJc_my story118,ESTJc,thinking about that all day I was like I
ESTJc_my story119,ESTJc,hope I can fall asleep tonight that was
ESTJc_my story120,ESTJc,so weird and then from there on it just
ESTJc_my story121,ESTJc,got worse and worse and I just started
ESTJc_my story122,ESTJc,developing really bad anxiety and it's
ESTJc_my story123,ESTJc,so weird even like sakes it sounds just
ESTJc_my story124,ESTJc,strange but my anxiety stemmed from like
ESTJc_my story125,ESTJc,my nervousness to sleep at night so I
ESTJc_my story126,ESTJc,would be thinking about that all day it
ESTJc_my story127,ESTJc,would just make me not present in real
ESTJc_my story128,ESTJc,life like during day because I would
ESTJc_my story129,ESTJc,just be so in my head and also so
ESTJc_my story130,ESTJc,exhausting when my mom suggested that I
ESTJc_my story131,ESTJc,start going to therapy to kind of like
ESTJc_my story132,ESTJc,talk through what was going on with
ESTJc_my story133,ESTJc,somebody so I went to a Christian
ESTJc_my story134,ESTJc,counselor she was so great I love
ESTJc_my story135,ESTJc,therapy and like I highly recommend
ESTJc_my story136,ESTJc,therapy for anybody I don't go to
ESTJc_my story137,ESTJc,therapy anymore but I would love to
ESTJc_my story138,ESTJc,start going again because I just feel
ESTJc_my story139,ESTJc,like it's nice to have someone who has
ESTJc_my story140,ESTJc,like a third party opinion about your
ESTJc_my story141,ESTJc,life that can just like help you through
ESTJc_my story142,ESTJc,things but anyway that helped like it
ESTJc_my story143,ESTJc,helped me process my emotions and it
ESTJc_my story144,ESTJc,kind of helped me understand why I had
ESTJc_my story145,ESTJc,developed this anxiety because like I
ESTJc_my story146,ESTJc,wasn't talking about anything to people
ESTJc_my story147,ESTJc,like I wasn't getting out my sadness
ESTJc_my story148,ESTJc,like it was just all brewing inside my
ESTJc_my story149,ESTJc,heart I think I did therapy for about
ESTJc_my story150,ESTJc,must have been like - it
ESTJc_my story151,ESTJc,phears and then i was about to have to
ESTJc_my story152,ESTJc,go to college and I got accepted to my
ESTJc_my story153,ESTJc,dream College Florida State University
ESTJc_my story154,ESTJc,and I was getting so nervous because I
ESTJc_my story155,ESTJc,was like I can't go to college like this
ESTJc_my story156,ESTJc,like I'm not gonna be able to function
ESTJc_my story157,ESTJc,like I'm just too much of like I'm just
ESTJc_my story158,ESTJc,too nervous and I hate being away from
ESTJc_my story159,ESTJc,home and like how am I just gonna get up
ESTJc_my story160,ESTJc,and move away and so one night I was
ESTJc_my story161,ESTJc,just like I was having a very horrible
ESTJc_my story162,ESTJc,night I remember I was having a panic
ESTJc_my story163,ESTJc,attack
ESTJc_my story164,ESTJc,I was laying in bed by myself like
ESTJc_my story165,ESTJc,hyperventilating and I was just so sad
ESTJc_my story166,ESTJc,so I was like that was kind of the
ESTJc_my story167,ESTJc,moment where I thought I'm not gonna be
ESTJc_my story168,ESTJc,able to go to college like I'm just
ESTJc_my story169,ESTJc,gonna have to go do like a college
ESTJc_my story170,ESTJc,around here where I live and just live
ESTJc_my story171,ESTJc,at home I remember at that time my life
ESTJc_my story172,ESTJc,God wasn't really like a priority to me
ESTJc_my story173,ESTJc,like it wasn't it was a priority but it
ESTJc_my story174,ESTJc,was more like oh yeah I'm a Christian
ESTJc_my story175,ESTJc,like I love God I believe in God but it
ESTJc_my story176,ESTJc,wasn't like I had a really deep every
ESTJc_my story177,ESTJc,single day relationship with God but in
ESTJc_my story178,ESTJc,that moment God touched my heart so much
ESTJc_my story179,ESTJc,and I remember getting on my knees on
ESTJc_my story180,ESTJc,the ground and praying to God I said God
ESTJc_my story181,ESTJc,please I give you all my anxiety I give
ESTJc_my story182,ESTJc,you my insomnia I give you all these
ESTJc_my story183,ESTJc,stresses and problems and I just want
ESTJc_my story184,ESTJc,you to have them take them from me and I
ESTJc_my story185,ESTJc,just want you to have all of the control
ESTJc_my story186,ESTJc,in my life I'm done trying to control
ESTJc_my story187,ESTJc,things myself
ESTJc_my story188,ESTJc,and give it to you and I just remember
ESTJc_my story189,ESTJc,feeling such a huge weight off my
ESTJc_my story190,ESTJc,shoulders and I just remember I'm gonna
ESTJc_my story191,ESTJc,cry again I just remember so vividly
ESTJc_my story192,ESTJc,feeling God tell me it's gonna be okay
ESTJc_my story193,ESTJc,I'm taking care of you you're gonna go
ESTJc_my story194,ESTJc,to college you're gonna be fine and just
ESTJc_my story195,ESTJc,trust me so this is a miracle and I've
ESTJc_my story196,ESTJc,shared this on YouTube before and I've
ESTJc_my story197,ESTJc,gotten comments saying that's not true
ESTJc_my story198,ESTJc,like that's impossible whatever I don't
ESTJc_my story199,ESTJc,care if you think it's impossible
ESTJc_my story200,ESTJc,because I know

ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)27,ISFJc,and I walked past a car and the car had
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)28,ISFJc,this sitting on its back windscreen and
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)29,ISFJc,I looked at it I was like oh my god I

ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)58,ISFJc,little bit and he guesses what it could
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)59,ISFJc,possibly be

ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)71,ISFJc,is probably my least favorite so far but
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)72,ISFJc,you know me I just can't help myself
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)73,ISFJc,when it comes to studded pink quilted
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)74,ISFJc,things are just nuts this isn't going to
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)75,ISFJc,fit mine on the plane at all because
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)76,ISFJc,this is actually sized for American
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)77,ISFJc,Knights but I actually just wanted to

ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)79,ISFJc,plate frame I wish that the Australian
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)80,ISFJc,umber plates would fit this because
ISFJc_I SPENT $500 AT WISH!!! HUGE CAR ACCESSORIES HAUL AND MAKEOVER (2019)81,ISFJc,that's amazing that's glorious but I'm

"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""9",ESTPc,know you are entitled to your opinion
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""10",ESTPc,and I am all ears it doesn't mean it's
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""11",ESTPc,good for my self-esteem but that's okay
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""12",ESTPc,cuz I can handle that with my therapy a
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""13",ESTPc,lot of people miss the old me you know I
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""14",ESTPc,used to be blonde in like more annoying
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""15",ESTPc,in my opinion and a lot more sad so that
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""16",ESTPc,was the old Emma Chamberlain whatever
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""17",ESTPc,that means now I'm apparently very
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""18",ESTPc,different you know I grew up a little
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""19",ESTPc,bit I moved out I moved to LA like uh in
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""20",ESTPc,my opinion I feel like I like myself
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""21",ESTPc,better now because I'm more myself than
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""22",ESTPc,I've ever been so I'm pretty content
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""23",ESTPc,with the place that I'm in you know what
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""24",ESTPc,I mean
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""25",ESTPc,and so those comments you know again
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""26",ESTPc,therapist discussion that will be
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""27",ESTPc,happening but today I'm gonna be turning
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""28",ESTPc,myself into the old Emma Chamberlain
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""29",ESTPc,because I'm in the city of San Francisco
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""30",ESTPc,right now this is kind of where I grew
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""31",ESTPc,up not really I grew up like near San
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""32",ESTPc,Francisco but I just say grew up in San
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""33",ESTPc,Francisco because it's like easier to
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""34",ESTPc,say than being like oh I groups south of
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""35",ESTPc,San Francisco and it was actually not as
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""36",ESTPc,cool CinemaScope like I sound a lot
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""37",ESTPc,cooler when I say group in San Francisco
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""38",ESTPc,but I'm here and so I thought in honor
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""39",ESTPc,of being here
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""40",ESTPc,I would transform myself into the old me
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""41",ESTPc,I just got this idea literally five
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""42",ESTPc,minutes ago and I was like wait that'd
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""43",ESTPc,be kind of funny because I'm here so
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""44",ESTPc,like and I'm gonna get nostalgic I
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""45",ESTPc,thought I would turn myself into the old
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""46",ESTPc,Emma Chamberlain give you guys what you
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""47",ESTPc,really want because this
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""48",ESTPc,we eat this we mix the blonde really sad
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""49",ESTPc,of a chamber so today we're bringing her
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""50",ESTPc,back for the day don't get too
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""51",ESTPc,comfortable because after today I'm
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""52",ESTPc,gonna be back to this so I'm turning
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""53",ESTPc,myself into the hold me and to get this
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""54",ESTPc,like kicked off I ordered my old Phil's
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""55",ESTPc,order because I get a different thing
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""56",ESTPc,now this will make sense if you don't
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""57",ESTPc,know what Phil's is cuz their orders are
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""58",ESTPc,super weird like the menu is super weird
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""59",ESTPc,but this is a large ice dancing water if
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""60",ESTPc,you don't know what that means I don't
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""61",ESTPc,know how to explain it now I get a
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""62",ESTPc,Jacob's Wonder Bar with almond milk but
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""63",ESTPc,instead of getting my current order
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""64",ESTPc,which is a Jacob's Wonder Bar I got the
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""65",ESTPc,dancing water it does taste nostalgic to
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""66",ESTPc,me I used to drink that every day when I
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""67",ESTPc,was the old Emma Chamberlain so I got
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""68",ESTPc,that to take this off but now let's get
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""69",ESTPc,started with the transformation I'm
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""70",ESTPc,gonna have to like kind of dig deep
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""71",ESTPc,because I kind of forgot who that person
"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""72",ESTPc,was

"ESTPc_""WE MISS THE OLD EMMA""74",ESTPc,like I forgot what my like what my

ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿20,ESTJc,like that obviously I try to be as
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿21,ESTJc,sustainable as possible but it's really
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿22,ESTJc,fucking hard at a grocery store because
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿23,ESTJc,mostly everything is in plastic but I do
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿24,ESTJc,think that we do kind of a good job with
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿25,ESTJc,the vegetables and pans and a lot of
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿26,ESTJc,paper stuff so we do what's what we can
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿27,ESTJc,and also we want to start shopping in
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿28,ESTJc,bulk we just have your going around to
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿29,ESTJc,buying like old containers yet we
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿30,ESTJc,literally just got a kitchen so like I
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿31,ESTJc,will shuffle give me a chance just let
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿32,ESTJc,me get there so let's just start with
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿33,ESTJc,like some dairy-free items so this is my
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿34,ESTJc,favorite dairy free yogurt it is silk
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿35,ESTJc,soy yogurt um I love the char berry and
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿36,ESTJc,the vanilla the vanilla tastes like
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿37,ESTJc,vanilla bean and it's so that I know
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿38,ESTJc,some people don't enjoy soy or don't
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿39,ESTJc,like the concept of soy but
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿40,ESTJc,so this is a really really good option
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿41,ESTJc,the only thing is that there's single
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿42,ESTJc,package so it's not that sustainable but
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿43,ESTJc,these are really good
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿44,ESTJc,only old milk is the best dairy-free
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿45,ESTJc,milk for cooking mashed potatoes vegan
ESTJc_huge vegan grocery haul!!!! ヽ(^o^)丿46,ESTJc,mac and cheese only oatmeal is your guy

ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie102,ESTJc,not sure about everyone else so it is a
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie103,ESTJc,nice dress but for me it's just an early
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie104,ESTJc,early bird come with me

ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie117,ESTJc,black dresses I've just shown are very
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie118,ESTJc,risky with the whole splits on though
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie119,ESTJc,I'm not sure how the splits are gonna
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie120,ESTJc,look I'm not sure they're going to be
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie121,ESTJc,appropriate but I really hope they are
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie122,ESTJc,so this is the dress I pad with a pair
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie123,ESTJc,or thigh high boots and I wanted to try

ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie125,ESTJc,look kind of good with that so I'm gonna
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie126,ESTJc,keep these on with that and this dress
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie127,ESTJc,kind of has the same issues the last one
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie128,ESTJc,and there's a lovely dress is that me

ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie131,ESTJc,just the only thing again is it's a bit
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie132,ESTJc,too revealing to wear out as such and I
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie133,ESTJc,need to me personally I think quite a
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie134,ESTJc,few people would feel comfortable
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie135,ESTJc,wearing this out but I just don't
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie136,ESTJc,because of the whole underwear thing
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie137,ESTJc,again your honor I would show through
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie138,ESTJc,this so you wouldn't be able to wear any
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie139,ESTJc,or it would show which I don't feel
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie140,ESTJc,comfortable of either way so I don't
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie141,ESTJc,think I'd be able to wear this out but
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie142,ESTJc,it is kind of what I expected it to look
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie143,ESTJc,like just I thought these straps will
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie144,ESTJc,kind of make it a bit easier to wear
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie145,ESTJc,underwear because they kind of cover it
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie146,ESTJc,and you just be able to wear and then it
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie147,ESTJc,would be like bit more cynical than it
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie148,ESTJc,is but others not I don't really think I
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie149,ESTJc,went out but if that is like your type

ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie154,ESTJc,again it's a no for me but only for that
ESTJc_TRYING ON $5 DRESSES FROM PRETTYLITTLETHING! | HelloItsAmie155,ESTJc,reason otherwise it would be 100 percent

ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams63,ENTJc,it was very obvious that that's what was
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams64,ENTJc,causing the problem so we had to get
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams65,ENTJc,them removed my eyelids now they're
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams66,ENTJc,pretty much healed they're still
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams67,ENTJc,slightly red and they're still kind of
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams68,ENTJc,dry but we're getting there I'm just
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams69,ENTJc,keeping them moisturize and we move on
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams70,ENTJc,so for today's makeup look I'm going to

ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams72,ENTJc,same so I don't really know where I was

ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams74,ENTJc,clean looking
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams75,ENTJc,but the lashes make your makeup look
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams76,ENTJc,glam that's the only thing that really
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams77,ENTJc,makes my makeup look glam cuz everything
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams78,ENTJc,else is pretty lightweight
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams79,ENTJc,I don't wear foundation I use a little
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams80,ENTJc,skin tint sometimes I may use that today
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams81,ENTJc,yeah we're just going for something
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams82,ENTJc,simple but we are using lashes so I
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams83,ENTJc,finished filling in my eyebrows they
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams84,ENTJc,look crazy because I've no other makeup
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams85,ENTJc,on right now but actually pretty proud
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams86,ENTJc,of them I've been feeling in my eyebrows
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams87,ENTJc,a lot more recently this past week and I
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams88,ENTJc,think we're getting better don't want to
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams89,ENTJc,do eyeshadow I don't every time I do
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams90,ENTJc,eyeshadow I usually regret it just
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams91,ENTJc,because I like the more simple look so
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams92,ENTJc,we're just gonna not so I am gonna go in
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams93,ENTJc,with a little bit of skin tint just to
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams94,ENTJc,kind of even out my complexion
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams95,ENTJc,it just overall gives you more of like
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams96,ENTJc,an airbrushed effect you know and then
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams97,ENTJc,blend it in with my dirty Beauty Blender
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams98,ENTJc,so it's basically like a foundation but
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams99,ENTJc,there's barely coverage it just kind of
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams100,ENTJc,evens out your skin tone basically and
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams101,ENTJc,gives you like a slightly smoother
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams102,ENTJc,complexion if you want coverage I would
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams103,ENTJc,not recommend a skin tint so like you
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams104,ENTJc,gave me an even skin complexion but then
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams105,ENTJc,I still have redness so that's when I go
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams106,ENTJc,in with concealer I'm just gonna put
ENTJc_Vlog: Come Fall Clothing Shopping With Me + Mini Haul! | Azlia Williams107,ENTJc,this on any areas that usually get red

ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds69,ENTJc,basically what I'm trying to say is
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds70,ENTJc,don't don't do this
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds71,ENTJc,No okay and with that I've been inspired
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds72,ENTJc,to do a video about the do's and don'ts
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds73,ENTJc,of helping a reptile that is shedding
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds74,ENTJc,and when you should intervene and when
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds75,ENTJc,you shouldn't intervene and why you
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds76,ENTJc,shouldn't do this basically so welcome

ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds130,ENTJc,I wasn't feeling the best and so I
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds131,ENTJc,decided my plan actually didn't work how
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds132,ENTJc,I intended it to I took a week off and I

ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds182,ENTJc,lizards like I said alligator lizards
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds183,ENTJc,and a few other species will shed all in
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds184,ENTJc,one piece while other lizards and even
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds185,ENTJc,turtles will shed in patches
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds186,ENTJc,now shedding is not a process that is
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds187,ENTJc,unique to reptiles and amphibians
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds188,ENTJc,all animals shed in a way even humans
ENTJc_This Snake Trend is NOT Satisfying | How to Help Bad Sheds189,ENTJc,shed every single day we are constantly

ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)0,ESFJc,"All right, so some of you might know that I just quit my data science job at bank"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)1,ESFJc,the reason why I'm not seeing explicitly which company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)2,ESFJc,"It's in case I need to go begging back for my job, you know, and I don't want them to say that"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)3,ESFJc,"Oh my god, what did you say this about a company?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)4,ESFJc,We're not gonna take you back now before I go into why I quit my job
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)5,ESFJc,I kind of have to re-explain what my role was as a data scientist
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)6,ESFJc,and the reason why I have to react splain it is because
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)7,ESFJc,It's not as standardized as like software engineering which is I mean III know I explained in a lot of videos
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)8,ESFJc,but I'm just gonna do it again just so that you can have
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)9,ESFJc,the right context to understand why I quit so basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)10,ESFJc,this was my job title at this company and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)11,ESFJc,"Yeah, so you can read it"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)12,ESFJc,so in essence in my words
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)13,ESFJc,A data scientist is usually put into a product team and usually in the product team. There's a product manager
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)14,ESFJc,"there are software engineers and there's a data scientist now, obviously there are other roles, you know, for example like UX researchers and"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)15,ESFJc,Like product specialists
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)16,ESFJc,"Marketing people legal people and stuff like that, but I'm just gonna you know, simplify it and say ok"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)17,ESFJc,So there's software engineers and data scientists and product managers
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)18,ESFJc,"So I'm not gonna explain it in a way where it's like, oh data scientists. They make models"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)19,ESFJc,"They use like R and likes are for engineers, they build infrastructure and they use programming languages blah blah blah"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)20,ESFJc,I'm not gonna explain like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)21,ESFJc,I'm gonna explain it in a more fundamental way of what their roles actually are. So
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)22,ESFJc,Engineers they actually have the technical abilities to build the thing. We actually want to build product managers
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)23,ESFJc,They're basically the leaders are like the owners of the product. They decide what the product is going to do
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)24,ESFJc,And also what the product should be doing. Basically they have the vision and they're in charge of actually executing getting the shit done and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)25,ESFJc,"You know, they'll do whatever they need to do to actually ship a product in some ways"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)26,ESFJc,You could think of them as like mini CEOs of a product or a feature and then data scientists
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)27,ESFJc,we have the most time to think because we
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)28,ESFJc,Don't need to like build anything like for engineers and stuff like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)29,ESFJc,And we also don't need to focus on execute and talking to cross-functional partners all the time
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)30,ESFJc,So in some ways because we're able to think more than those two counterparts
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)31,ESFJc,We're basically like advisors are like consultants of like the product. We don't actually make the final decisions and calls
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)32,ESFJc,I mean obviously your opinions matter
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)33,ESFJc,but in in essence the the people who had the final say are kind of the product managers and also the engineers because
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)34,ESFJc,The engineers are going to build it so they could build whatever they want and then product managers
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)35,ESFJc,They're the ones
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)36,ESFJc,They're the ones that decide on the future of the product now because we have so much time to think our job is
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)37,ESFJc,To try to understand the product inside and out. We're suppose
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)38,ESFJc,Not I'm not saying all data scientists do that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)39,ESFJc,but I think
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)40,ESFJc,That the fundamental role of a data scientist is to understand the product in and out better than anyone else
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)41,ESFJc,"The reason is because like I said, you have more time to think you have more time in your hand"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)42,ESFJc,So basically we use data to try to understand exactly
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)43,ESFJc,what the product needs and where the product should go in terms of the product direction and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)44,ESFJc,What we can do is we can tell our team exactly where we should prioritize and how we should do certain things
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)45,ESFJc,"Why because we have so much time to think about it, you know, we don't need to build stuff"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)46,ESFJc,We don't need to execute on anything. So that's a role
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)47,ESFJc,We're always making sure that the team is working on the most important things
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)48,ESFJc,"Currently, okay, I'll do one more analogy just because I like doing analogies. So imagine a youtube channel, right?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)49,ESFJc,Engineers would be like video producers which is the people who actually know how to make videos because in the end if you don't have
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)50,ESFJc,A video you're not gonna have a video channel
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)51,ESFJc,"so I think of Engineers like video producers and then product managers, I think of product managers as"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)52,ESFJc,The people who?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)53,ESFJc,What it doesn't need to be multiple people
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)54,ESFJc,it could just be one person but basically the person who sends emails tries to look for sponsorships and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)55,ESFJc,"They think about okay, where should this channel go? Basically they do everything that's not related to videos"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)56,ESFJc,"You know, we got Brandon we got sending emails making websites communicating with other youtubers. Basically just all the crap that"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)57,ESFJc,Video producers might not want to do so
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)58,ESFJc,I think those people are like the product and then we got a data science
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)59,ESFJc,The data scientists would be kind of like an an analyst of your YouTube channel
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)60,ESFJc,What analysis would do is they would all they always look at analytics to make sure that?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)61,ESFJc,You know you get some insights to know what kind of videos to make next like for example
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)62,ESFJc,You look at the views and they say that okay
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)63,ESFJc,You know these things are kind of hot right now or this is kind of trending
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)64,ESFJc,And you look at comments - basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)65,ESFJc,"You're like you're trying to understand your users the best way you can using data or anything. Actually, it doesn't even matter"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)66,ESFJc,It doesn't even need to be data. So basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)67,ESFJc,those are the fundamental rows basically a data scientist should figure out you know how to get more subscribers how to get more views and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)68,ESFJc,Why are certain things working or are certain things not working?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)69,ESFJc,"So then give them insights give the product manager or like the video producer insights into like okay, which you make next"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)70,ESFJc,How should we you know like these strategies? Okay. I know that was kind of long just to explain
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)71,ESFJc,"fundamentally, what a data scientist is"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)72,ESFJc,Fuck I need water
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)73,ESFJc,"Okay, I'm too lazy to get water okay, but um basically the reason why I quit my data science job in essence"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)74,ESFJc,It's because I'm still exploring
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)75,ESFJc,so I guess what I'm trying to say is a lot of people are content with their first job out of college and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)76,ESFJc,For my case. I think that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)77,ESFJc,For the first years out of your college
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)78,ESFJc,It is totally okay to keep searching and try to understand yourself and try to understand what exactly
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)79,ESFJc,"Is a right fit for your in terms of a job like I prioritize well, I might be wrong"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)80,ESFJc,"I don't know but I prioritize long term like for example, if"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)81,ESFJc,"you know, I just stuck of data scientists and"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)82,ESFJc,In the future. I realize I hate the job
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)83,ESFJc,then the cost of switching jobs is a lot higher later on if I was already five years or six years in so I do
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)84,ESFJc,think that sacrificing the first few years
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)85,ESFJc,Trying to discover what you actually want
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)86,ESFJc,"It's definitely beneficial for your career. Hopefully, I don't know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)87,ESFJc,"We'll see so I'm not saying oh by the way, I'm switching to software engineering"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)88,ESFJc,I have a feeling that some people don't know but I'm not saying that software engineering is my
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)89,ESFJc,True calling or that this is the final job that I want. I don't know. I'm not sure I might be wrong
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)90,ESFJc,"You know, I might not even last for like another year or two"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)91,ESFJc,But in the current state that I am right now
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)92,ESFJc,"I feel that I don't want to do you know the analytics part like, you know?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)93,ESFJc,The YouTube guy where he just looks at analytics. I kind of want to make videos
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)94,ESFJc,I want to be a video producer
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)95,ESFJc,"So in this analogy, it means that I want to build things and I think that's currently what I want"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)96,ESFJc,at least what I think I want so that's why I'm gonna try out a software engineering now and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)97,ESFJc,"Yeah, cuz I thought that I was always a builder, you know, I do like some aspects of data scientists"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)98,ESFJc,"But you know, I want to try to build stuff this time like I think at the core"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)99,ESFJc,"My personality does fit more of a builder, you know, I do like building stuff. But yeah, so yeah"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)100,ESFJc,So those are the arguments of me wanting to become a software engineer
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)101,ESFJc,So I'm gonna talk about some things about why I don't want to be a data scientist anymore
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)102,ESFJc,So at least at my company or my old company the way you get
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)103,ESFJc,Evaluated no matter what role you have is how much impact you have?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)104,ESFJc,And basically what impact means is if you did you have like a positive contribution to the company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)105,ESFJc,"So even if you worked your ass off or you did, you know, you do a lot of smart intelligent things"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)106,ESFJc,But it doesn't have any positive impact to a company or like it doesn't really change anything
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)107,ESFJc,Then you still might get fired after a while. So as a data scientist using the scope that I talked about like the fundamental ROS
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)108,ESFJc,basically
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)109,ESFJc,how a data scientist can have impact in a company like that is by
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)110,ESFJc,Make like being like influencing the product. This is
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)111,ESFJc,influencing the product direction
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)112,ESFJc,so for a data scientist using that scope of like fundamental ROS a
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)113,ESFJc,Data scientists how they can have impact is by you know
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)114,ESFJc,Making analysis or something such that it leads into
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)115,ESFJc,actionable
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)116,ESFJc,Insight meaning that people will use that insight and then they'll take action to towards it and then it will benefit the company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)117,ESFJc,"So that's impact. All right, so I have a few examples. I'm just gonna read it out loud because I I can't remember them"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)118,ESFJc,So basically in a simple way if your analysis convey the engineers to build something and our metrics went up
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)119,ESFJc,That's impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)120,ESFJc,"Also, if your analysis convinced the PM and the team to put a new feature a or a project on the roadmap"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)121,ESFJc,That's impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)122,ESFJc,If you create an amazing
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)123,ESFJc,Prediction algorithm to predict whether a user watched a video with alone in their apartment or with friends
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)124,ESFJc,But the team didn't decide to implement it because they don't think it's useful that is not impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)125,ESFJc,if you found that Korea is a growing market for live videos and you have tons of evidence that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)126,ESFJc,Adding a donation button can make your company dominant in the live video market in in Korea
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)127,ESFJc,But even with their sound evidence you cannot convince your product team to focus on Korea. That is not impact
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)128,ESFJc,So as you can see
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)129,ESFJc,it's not always a hundred percent fair because for some team it might be easier than another and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)130,ESFJc,There's a lot of factor that plays into the success of a data scientist and some of them are out of your control
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)131,ESFJc,And that was one thing that I found a little bit harder to cope with
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)132,ESFJc,Now I've worked with teams where it was really really easy to find opportunities and then you show those
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)133,ESFJc,"Opportunities to them and then they're super excited and they'll do it, you know, and that's a lot of impact"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)134,ESFJc,but I've also worked for teams that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)135,ESFJc,Move a lot
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)136,ESFJc,"slower against a more friction and basically, you know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)137,ESFJc,you don't have as much credibility to them and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)138,ESFJc,And it's a lot more difficult to convince them to do what you want to do. So that's why it's a little bit harder
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)139,ESFJc,"So and basically if you have no influence, you don't have impact as a data scientist now"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)140,ESFJc,"Sometimes you might be lucky that your work is so good that your work speaks for itself, right?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)141,ESFJc,But the reality is that in life that's not always the case. Sometimes you just have to be influential
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)142,ESFJc,"Basically, you have to have the skills to influence your peers let your engineering manager the product manager"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)143,ESFJc,you have to get them in the same team as you or you have to basically or
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)144,ESFJc,"Basically, you have to kind of convince them that your ideas are good and that they should implement it. But that's the thing"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)145,ESFJc,It doesn't always happen and sometimes you gotta be pretty good at like the office politics or like
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)146,ESFJc,you know stuff that or more like soft skills ish and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)147,ESFJc,I believe those were the skills I lacked or at least that's why I thought before and which made me kind of like yeah
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)148,ESFJc,Like believe it or not. I'm actually
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)149,ESFJc,kind of like a work introvert so
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)150,ESFJc,I'm also like still very inexperienced in in in understanding like the work
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)151,ESFJc,Dynamics and also like some office politics and stuff like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)152,ESFJc,I'm still quite new. So I mean I did get better but at the time
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)153,ESFJc,that was what made me want to switch to software engineering because I felt like I wasn't ready to be a product leader on my
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)154,ESFJc,"Team, I didn't feel like I had the maturity to make and influence decisions on my team"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)155,ESFJc,I didn't have the confidence in myself nor my work and that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)156,ESFJc,"Stressed me out. Yeah, that stressed me out now. Don't get me wrong"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)157,ESFJc,there's a lot of
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)158,ESFJc,aspects of data science that I
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)159,ESFJc,Enjoy and that I like and that I still like and I do hope that when I work as a suite that I could use
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)160,ESFJc,some of the things that I've learned and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)161,ESFJc,and use it as my advantage but basically how I think about it like my philosophy is that your goal should be like
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)162,ESFJc,"Oh, I should be really I should be a really good data scientist, or I should be a really good software engineer"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)163,ESFJc,You should be the ultimate worker
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)164,ESFJc,"Okay, that sounds kind of weird"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)165,ESFJc,"But basically what I'm trying to say is you want to be the guy who can solve everything with anything, right?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)166,ESFJc,Like if there's a problem
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)167,ESFJc,You're the guide to solve it
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)168,ESFJc,No matter if it's a technical problem a business problem or like analytics problem and stuff like that
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)169,ESFJc,you want to be the guy that people can depend on and that's the person that I'm trying to be and
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)170,ESFJc,For now the skills. I want to work on or you know building skills like a software engineer
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)171,ESFJc,"So yeah, I mean, I haven't done that in ages. I kind of miss it. Okay"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)172,ESFJc,"So now what you know, what am I doing now? Well, I am unemployed"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)173,ESFJc,"So basically what I do is every day, I just sit on my ass and I work on interview problems"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)174,ESFJc,I do a couple of questions on alcoholics per die. Oh just so that I can refresh my memory on these coding interviews. Yeah
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)175,ESFJc,It's a good website. I highly recommend it
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)176,ESFJc,"Yeah, you should check it out. If you're if you're interviewing also, what else have I been doing?"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)177,ESFJc,"Yeah, so, you know because I have so much time in my hand"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)178,ESFJc,I've been going to blind a lot blind. Is this like Anonymous?
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)179,ESFJc,Forum app that you can check you could check like gossip
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)180,ESFJc,so basically when I worked at like my company X
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)181,ESFJc,what I could have done is I could have gone to
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)182,ESFJc,Blind and see what other people were talking about that also worked at company X so a basic a lots of gossip
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)183,ESFJc,But I also use it for non gossip and there's a lot of stuff that you can read about in like normal topics
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)184,ESFJc,We're just a bunch of people from Silicon Valley
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)185,ESFJc,"They just talk about random stuff and most of the time to talk about, you know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)186,ESFJc,switching company
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)187,ESFJc,interviewing at your TCC
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)188,ESFJc,Total compensation how much they make it's a good way for me to get a feel of what the market is like right now
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)189,ESFJc,So I use it a lot
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)190,ESFJc,"Almost obsessively a lot of times I check like okay, you know"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)191,ESFJc,You know company X interview process to kind of get a feel of like how they interview you. So that's what I do
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)192,ESFJc,I mean you guys should totally check it out. It's pretty cool
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)193,ESFJc,You know lots of lots of anonymous talks there
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)194,ESFJc,"yeah, so basically, um, you know, I mean I get a lot of questions sometimes from people saying like oh,"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)195,ESFJc,"How should I do X or where what should I do to find X Y or whatever. Oh wait, my camera's almost on"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)196,ESFJc,"Yeah, so pretty much like I get a lot of questions where sometimes I don't even know the answer"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)197,ESFJc,"But how do I get the answers, you know, I go to Google I go to you know algo expert to learn some stuff"
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)198,ESFJc,I use blind to understand how the interview process or like I use a lot of these websites
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)199,ESFJc,So I feel like you know instead of me answering all the questions for you guys
ESFJc_Why I left my Data Science Job at FANG (Facebook Amazon Netflix Google)200,ESFJc,"I should just give you the tools to answer these questions, right? So there's this quote. You know what they say"
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool0,ESTJc,good morning everyone how amazing that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool1,ESTJc,Ted is in a school I just think that's
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool2,ESTJc,just so exciting
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool3,ESTJc,well I and I teach people about the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool4,ESTJc,brain and 30 years ago I asked a
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool5,ESTJc,ridiculous question and so and it really
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool6,ESTJc,was a ridiculous question there's the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool7,ESTJc,question can the mind change the brain
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool8,ESTJc,now that was a ridiculous question
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool9,ESTJc,because the view at that time and the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool10,ESTJc,scientists that trained me and my
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool11,ESTJc,lecturers we were told that the brain
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool12,ESTJc,could not change so if it was damaged
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool13,ESTJc,well that's it you just basically had to
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool14,ESTJc,teach your patience rest to compensate
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool15,ESTJc,for these things and to kind of get
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool16,ESTJc,around the problem but that seems such a
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool17,ESTJc,negative thing so I asked that question
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool18,ESTJc,cannot kind of brain that damage can it
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool19,ESTJc,not change can athon grow and a brain
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool20,ESTJc,that's not damaged can't we make that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool21,ESTJc,better contry increase our intelligence
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool22,ESTJc,and so I decided to embark on a journey
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool23,ESTJc,of researching and studying this and
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool24,ESTJc,applying it in my practice I was
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool25,ESTJc,determined to prove that the mind could
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool26,ESTJc,change the brain which implies that the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool27,ESTJc,mind is separate from the brain but
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool28,ESTJc,influencing the brain so I started off
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool29,ESTJc,30 years ago in practice and I worked
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool30,ESTJc,I've decided to work with people with
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool31,ESTJc,learning disabilities and with traumatic
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool32,ESTJc,brain injury with specifically with the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool33,ESTJc,learning disabled communities the older
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool34,ESTJc,children so was we were also told back
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool35,ESTJc,then that once you hit the age of 10
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool36,ESTJc,sort of 10 to 12 well then you too old
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool37,ESTJc,to have much done for you so you'd have
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool38,ESTJc,to you could get some remedial therapy
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool39,ESTJc,and things like that but there wasn't a
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool40,ESTJc,huge amount that you could do for your
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool41,ESTJc,brain so here I was coming out of
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool42,ESTJc,university keen to help people but being
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool43,ESTJc,told that we'll just teach your patients
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool44,ESTJc,to compensate well I wasn't going to do
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool45,ESTJc,that because I didn't believe that that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool46,ESTJc,was the best thing to do for anyone I
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool47,ESTJc,also know that thoughts are real things
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool48,ESTJc,that occupy mental real estate and that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool49,ESTJc,as we are thinking we are choosing and
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool50,ESTJc,we are building sorts inside of our
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool51,ESTJc,brain I also believe that you're as
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool52,ESTJc,intelligent as you want to be so the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool53,ESTJc,more you think deeply the more
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool54,ESTJc,intellectually
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool55,ESTJc,challenging you the challenges you put
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool56,ESTJc,in front of yourself the more you're
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool57,ESTJc,going to grow your brain so my first few
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool58,ESTJc,patients that I worked with the in my
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool59,ESTJc,practice were patients with traumatic
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool60,ESTJc,brain injury patients that had suffered
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool61,ESTJc,from severe car accidents and had
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool62,ESTJc,suffered severe traumatic brain injuries
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool63,ESTJc,I also worked with older the older
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool64,ESTJc,learning disabled population I worked
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool65,ESTJc,with people with from heart attack
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool66,ESTJc,victims had strokes various different
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool67,ESTJc,things were they presented with quite
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool68,ESTJc,major damage inside their brain and I
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool69,ESTJc,decided to throw all traditional methods
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool70,ESTJc,and start and trying to understand the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool71,ESTJc,science of sort and to work with things
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool72,ESTJc,that actually were meaningful for them
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool73,ESTJc,one of the problems with doing the kind
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool74,ESTJc,of therapy that I was trained to do was
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool75,ESTJc,something called carryover where you
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool76,ESTJc,would teach a patient in a therapy room
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool77,ESTJc,do give them therapy and then they would
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool78,ESTJc,have to carry that over into the into
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool79,ESTJc,their daily life and carryover wasn't
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool80,ESTJc,very good so I don't think that it would
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool81,ESTJc,be very good therapists if I couldn't
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool82,ESTJc,teach them to change their brain and I
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool83,ESTJc,couldn't teach them to make a difference
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool84,ESTJc,in their life so I would ask them the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool85,ESTJc,question what is the most important
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool86,ESTJc,thing that you need to do and obviously
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool87,ESTJc,the students that were at school they
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool88,ESTJc,wanted to work on schoolwork people that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool89,ESTJc,had in a former businessman and woman
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool90,ESTJc,that we're now sitting with brain damage
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool91,ESTJc,they wanted to get back to their former
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool92,ESTJc,status so that was my challenge
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool93,ESTJc,traumatic brain injury at that stage
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool94,ESTJc,back in and I talk about that surge I'm
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool95,ESTJc,talking 30 years ago so back in the 80s
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool96,ESTJc,where it was not accepted that your
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool97,ESTJc,brain can change traumatic brain injury
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool98,ESTJc,particularly was a it was a disorder in
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool99,ESTJc,search of data which means that the the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool100,ESTJc,scientists believed at that stage that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool101,ESTJc,the damage was so diffused that you
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool102,ESTJc,couldn't do anything for their brain so
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool103,ESTJc,I started working with a I had a patient
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool104,ESTJc,that came to my practice and this young
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool105,ESTJc,woman was amazing she had a terrible
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool106,ESTJc,terrible car accident she was thrown
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool107,ESTJc,from the car she was in look he was
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool108,ESTJc,basically in a coma for nearly two weeks
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool109,ESTJc,and in that day and age when if someone
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool110,ESTJc,was in a coma for longer than eight
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool111,ESTJc,hours their brain damage was considered
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool112,ESTJc,irreversible
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool113,ESTJc,so who parents were told the doctors
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool114,ESTJc,told her parents that she'd be a
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool115,ESTJc,vegetable well 14 months after her exit
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool116,ESTJc,after accident
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool117,ESTJc,parents approached me she wasn't a
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool118,ESTJc,vegetable she'd come around
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool119,ESTJc,she had progress she was so determined
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool120,ESTJc,she had used her mind she had she had
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool121,ESTJc,pushed through and she was functioning
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool122,ESTJc,at around about a fourth grade level now
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool123,ESTJc,that may sound strange but she was 16 at
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool124,ESTJc,the time of the accident so she had lost
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool125,ESTJc,14 months her peer group were going into
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool126,ESTJc,12th grade and she was now functioning
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool127,ESTJc,at around a fourth grade level so I was
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool128,ESTJc,really nervous that I have to be honest
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool129,ESTJc,with you because I was just embarking on
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool130,ESTJc,this field of research I was learning
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool131,ESTJc,how I was researching how the science of
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool132,ESTJc,thought how thoughts form that thoughts
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool133,ESTJc,are real that as you are thinking and
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool134,ESTJc,choosing you actually building these
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool135,ESTJc,quarry causing genetic expression in
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool136,ESTJc,your brain and you're growing these
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool137,ESTJc,thoughts in your brain and how can we do
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool138,ESTJc,this effectively and what is the if we
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool139,ESTJc,can we control our thinking so I told
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool140,ESTJc,them listen you know this is
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool141,ESTJc,experimental but you can work with me
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool142,ESTJc,and 14 months post-accident is also not
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool143,ESTJc,the greatest time to work with a patient
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool144,ESTJc,because they've kind of hit a plateau
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool145,ESTJc,where they're not really going to
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool146,ESTJc,progress much more long story short
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool147,ESTJc,eight months later this young girl not
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool148,ESTJc,only did she catch up with and make
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool149,ESTJc,close that gap but she went into 12th
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool150,ESTJc,grade she wrote 12th grade with her peer
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool151,ESTJc,group went on to finish school she
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool152,ESTJc,graduated went on to get a degree
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool153,ESTJc,she changed dramatically she and what
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool154,ESTJc,did she do the big thing about this
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool155,ESTJc,young woman was she chose to direct her
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool156,ESTJc,mind she chose to use her intellect she
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool157,ESTJc,was determined she thought she was
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool158,ESTJc,thinking so hard about all the things
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool159,ESTJc,that she was learning she set with her
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool160,ESTJc,schoolwork
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool161,ESTJc,day in and day out for hours applying
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool162,ESTJc,the techniques that I had been
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool163,ESTJc,developing and learning what's very
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool164,ESTJc,interesting and you'll see the first
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool165,ESTJc,slide is over of an IQ her IQ now with a
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool166,ESTJc,traumatic brain injury
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool167,ESTJc,basically IQ generally goes down around
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool168,ESTJc,20 points because of the kind of damage
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool169,ESTJc,with traumatic traumatic brain injury or
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool170,ESTJc,her IQ was a hundred before the accident
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool171,ESTJc,it was a hundred and twenty after the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool172,ESTJc,accident so here with holes in her brain
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool173,ESTJc,and brain damage she changed she
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool174,ESTJc,actually increased her intelligence now
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool175,ESTJc,I'm pretty convinced at this stage
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool176,ESTJc,because I've been working beside - I've
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool177,ESTJc,been working with lots and lots of other
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool178,ESTJc,patients
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool179,ESTJc,even the same thing when these students
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool180,ESTJc,applied their mind their brain was
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool181,ESTJc,changing the academic results were
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool182,ESTJc,changing so I was working on the
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool183,ESTJc,cognitive side on the academic side
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool184,ESTJc,showing them how to process this
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool185,ESTJc,information how to read how to think how
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool186,ESTJc,to ask answer and discuss their ways
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool187,ESTJc,through information how to write that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool188,ESTJc,down and capture that information how to
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool189,ESTJc,make sure that they could go back and
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool190,ESTJc,compare what they had written down and
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool191,ESTJc,look at the original work and do they
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool192,ESTJc,understand and does this make sense it
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool193,ESTJc,was and then being able to reteach that
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool194,ESTJc,and explain it I was explaining these
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool195,ESTJc,students we would spend hours working
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool196,ESTJc,through these techniques and applying it
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool197,ESTJc,to this school and I saw change all over
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool198,ESTJc,the place so then I thought well this is
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool199,ESTJc,great this is wonderful I'm seeing these
ESTJc_Science of Thought | Caroline Leaf | TEDxOaksChristianSchool200,ESTJc,incredible changes and up here on the
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose0,ENFJc,Let's play a game.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose1,ENFJc,"Imagine that you are in Las Vegas,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose2,ENFJc,"in a casino,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose3,ENFJc,"and you decide to play a game
on one of the casino's computers,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose4,ENFJc,"just like you might play
solitaire or chess."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose5,ENFJc,"The computer can make moves
in the game, just like a human player."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose6,ENFJc,This is a coin game.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose7,ENFJc,"It starts with a coin showing heads,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose8,ENFJc,and the computer will play first.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose9,ENFJc,"It can choose to flip the coin or not,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose10,ENFJc,but you don't get to see the outcome.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose11,ENFJc,"Next, it's your turn."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose12,ENFJc,"You can also choose
to flip the coin or not,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose13,ENFJc,"and your move will not be revealed
to your opponent, the computer."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose14,ENFJc,"Finally, the computer plays again,
and can flip the coin or not,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose15,ENFJc,"and after these three rounds,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose16,ENFJc,"the coin is revealed,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose17,ENFJc,"and if it is heads, the computer wins,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose18,ENFJc,"if it's tails, you win."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose19,ENFJc,"So it's a pretty simple game,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose20,ENFJc,"and if everybody plays honestly,
and the coin is fair,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose21,ENFJc,"then you have a 50 percent chance
of winning this game."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose22,ENFJc,"And to confirm that,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose23,ENFJc,"I asked my students to play
this game on our computers,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose24,ENFJc,"and after many, many tries,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose25,ENFJc,"their winning rate ended up
being 50 percent, or close to 50 percent,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose26,ENFJc,as expected.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose27,ENFJc,"Sounds like a boring game, right?"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose28,ENFJc,"But what if you could play this game
on a quantum computer?"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose29,ENFJc,"Now, Las Vegas casinos
do not have quantum computers,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose30,ENFJc,"as far as I know,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose31,ENFJc,"but IBM has built
a working quantum computer."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose32,ENFJc,Here it is.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose33,ENFJc,But what is a quantum computer?
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose34,ENFJc,"Well, quantum physics describes"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose35,ENFJc,"the behavior of atoms
and fundamental particles,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose36,ENFJc,like electrons and photons.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose37,ENFJc,So a quantum computer operates
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose38,ENFJc,"by controlling the behavior
of these particles,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose39,ENFJc,"but in a way that is completely different
from our regular computers."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose40,ENFJc,"So a quantum computer
is not just a more powerful version"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose41,ENFJc,"of our current computers,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose42,ENFJc,"just like a light bulb
is not a more powerful candle."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose43,ENFJc,"You cannot build a light bulb
by building better and better candles."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose44,ENFJc,"A light bulb is a different technology,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose45,ENFJc,based on deeper scientific understanding.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose46,ENFJc,"Similarly, a quantum computer
is a new kind of device,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose47,ENFJc,"based on the science of quantum physics,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose48,ENFJc,"and just like a light bulb
transformed society,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose49,ENFJc,"quantum computers
have the potential to impact"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose50,ENFJc,"so many aspects of our lives,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose51,ENFJc,"including our security needs,
our health care and even the internet."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose52,ENFJc,"So companies all around the world
are working to build these devices,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose53,ENFJc,"and to see what
the excitement is all about,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose54,ENFJc,let's play our game on a quantum computer.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose55,ENFJc,"So I can log into IBM's
quantum computer from right here,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose56,ENFJc,"which means I can play the game remotely,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose57,ENFJc,and so can you.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose58,ENFJc,"To make this happen, you may remember
getting an email ahead of time, from TED,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose59,ENFJc,"asking you whether you would choose
to flip the coin or not,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose60,ENFJc,if you played the game.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose61,ENFJc,"Well, actually, we asked you to choose
between a circle or a square."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose62,ENFJc,"You didn't know it, but your choice
of circle meant ""flip the coin,"""
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose63,ENFJc,"and your choice of square
was ""don't flip."""
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose64,ENFJc,We received 372 responses.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose65,ENFJc,Thank you.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose66,ENFJc,"That means we can play 372 games
against the quantum computer"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose67,ENFJc,using your choices.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose68,ENFJc,"And it's a pretty fast game to play,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose69,ENFJc,so I can show you the results right here.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose70,ENFJc,"Unfortunately, you didn't do very well."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose71,ENFJc,(Laughter)
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose72,ENFJc,"The quantum computer won
almost every game."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose73,ENFJc,"It lost a few only because
of operational errors in the computer."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose74,ENFJc,(Laughter)
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose75,ENFJc,"So how did it achieve
this amazing winning streak?"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose76,ENFJc,"It seems like magic or cheating,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose77,ENFJc,"but actually, it's just
quantum physics in action."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose78,ENFJc,Here's how it works.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose79,ENFJc,"A regular computer simulates
heads or tails of a coin as a bit,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose80,ENFJc,"a zero or a one,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose81,ENFJc,"or a current flipping on and off
inside your computer chip."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose82,ENFJc,"A quantum computer
is completely different."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose83,ENFJc,"A quantum bit has a more fluid,
nonbinary identity."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose84,ENFJc,"It can exist in a superposition,
or a combination of zero and one,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose85,ENFJc,"with some probability of being zero
and some probability of being one."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose86,ENFJc,"In other words,
its identity is on a spectrum."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose87,ENFJc,"For example, it could have
a 70 percent chance of being zero"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose88,ENFJc,and a 30 percent chance of being one
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose89,ENFJc,or 80-20 or 60-40.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose90,ENFJc,The possibilities are endless.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose91,ENFJc,The key idea here
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose92,ENFJc,"is that we have to give up
on precise values of zero and one"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose93,ENFJc,and allow for some uncertainty.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose94,ENFJc,"So during the game,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose95,ENFJc,"the quantum computer creates
this fluid combination of heads and tails,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose96,ENFJc,"zero and one,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose97,ENFJc,"so that no matter what the player does,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose98,ENFJc,"flip or no flip,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose99,ENFJc,the superposition remains intact.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose100,ENFJc,"It's kind of like stirring
a mixture of two fluids."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose101,ENFJc,"Whether or not you stir,
the fluids remain in a mixture,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose102,ENFJc,"but in its final move,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose103,ENFJc,"the quantum computer
can unmix the zero and one,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose104,ENFJc,"perfectly recovering heads
so that you lose every time."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose105,ENFJc,(Laughter)
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose106,ENFJc,"If you think this is all a bit weird,
you are absolutely right."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose107,ENFJc,"Regular coins do not exist
in combinations of heads and tails."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose108,ENFJc,"We do not experience
this fluid quantum reality"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose109,ENFJc,in our everyday lives.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose110,ENFJc,"So if you are confused by quantum,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose111,ENFJc,"don't worry, you're getting it."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose112,ENFJc,(Laughter)
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose113,ENFJc,"But even though we don't experience
quantum strangeness,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose114,ENFJc,"we can see its very real
effects in action."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose115,ENFJc,You've seen the data for yourself.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose116,ENFJc,The quantum computer won
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose117,ENFJc,"because it harnessed
superposition and uncertainty,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose118,ENFJc,"and these quantum properties are powerful,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose119,ENFJc,"not just to win coin games,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose120,ENFJc,"but also to build
future quantum technologies."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose121,ENFJc,"So let me give you three examples
of potential applications"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose122,ENFJc,that could change our lives.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose123,ENFJc,"First of all, quantum uncertainty
could be used to create private keys"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose124,ENFJc,"for encrypting messages
sent from one location to another"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose125,ENFJc,"so that hackers could not
secretly copy the key perfectly,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose126,ENFJc,because of quantum uncertainty.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose127,ENFJc,"They would have to break
the laws of quantum physics"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose128,ENFJc,to hack the key.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose129,ENFJc,"So this kind of unbreakable encryption
is already being tested by banks"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose130,ENFJc,and other institutions worldwide.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose131,ENFJc,"Today, we use more than 17 billion
connected devices globally."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose132,ENFJc,"Just imagine the impact quantum encryption
could have in the future."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose133,ENFJc,"Secondly, quantum technologies could also
transform health care and medicine."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose134,ENFJc,"For example, the design and analysis
of molecules for drug development"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose135,ENFJc,"is a challenging problem today,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose136,ENFJc,"and that's because
exactly describing and calculating"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose137,ENFJc,"all of the quantum properties
of all the atoms in the molecule"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose138,ENFJc,"is a computationally difficult task,
even for our supercomputers."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose139,ENFJc,"But a quantum computer could do better,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose140,ENFJc,"because it operates using
the same quantum properties"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose141,ENFJc,as the molecule it's trying to simulate.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose142,ENFJc,"So future large-scale quantum
simulations for drug development"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose143,ENFJc,"could perhaps lead to treatments
for diseases like Alzheimer's,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose144,ENFJc,which affects thousands of lives.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose145,ENFJc,"And thirdly, my favorite
quantum application"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose146,ENFJc,"is teleportation of information
from one location to another"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose147,ENFJc,"without physically transmitting
the information."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose148,ENFJc,"Sounds like sci-fi, but it is possible,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose149,ENFJc,"because these fluid identities
of the quantum particles"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose150,ENFJc,can get entangled across space and time
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose151,ENFJc,"in such a way that when you change
something about one particle,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose152,ENFJc,"it can impact the other,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose153,ENFJc,"and that creates
a channel for teleportation."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose154,ENFJc,"It's already been demonstrated
in research labs"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose155,ENFJc,"and could be part
of a future quantum internet."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose156,ENFJc,"We don't have such a network as yet,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose157,ENFJc,"but my team is working
on these possibilities,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose158,ENFJc,"by simulating a quantum network
on a quantum computer."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose159,ENFJc,"So we have designed and implemented
some interesting new protocols"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose160,ENFJc,"such as teleportation
among different users in the network"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose161,ENFJc,and efficient data transmission
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose162,ENFJc,and even secure voting.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose163,ENFJc,"So it's a lot of fun for me,
being a quantum physicist."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose164,ENFJc,I highly recommend it.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose165,ENFJc,(Laughter)
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose166,ENFJc,"We get to be explorers
in a quantum wonderland."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose167,ENFJc,"Who knows what applications
we will discover next."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose168,ENFJc,We must tread carefully and responsibly
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose169,ENFJc,as we build our quantum future.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose170,ENFJc,"And for me, personally,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose171,ENFJc,"I don't see quantum physics as a tool
just to build quantum computers."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose172,ENFJc,"I see quantum computers as a way
for us to probe the mysteries of nature"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose173,ENFJc,"and reveal more about this hidden world
outside of our experiences."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose174,ENFJc,"How amazing that we humans,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose175,ENFJc,"with our relatively limited
access to the universe,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose176,ENFJc,can still see far beyond our horizons
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose177,ENFJc,"just using our imagination
and our ingenuity."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose178,ENFJc,And the universe rewards us
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose179,ENFJc,"by showing us how incredibly
interesting and surprising it is."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose180,ENFJc,"The future is fundamentally uncertain,"
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose181,ENFJc,"and to me, that is certainly exciting."
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose182,ENFJc,Thank you.
ENFJc_A beginner's guide to quantum computing | Shohini Ghose183,ENFJc,(Applause)

ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm1,ISTPc,"In 2009, a man, a journalist
by the name Rob Walker,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm2,ISTPc,wanted to find out this:
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm3,ISTPc,"Is storytelling really
the most powerful tool of all?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm4,ISTPc,"And in order to do this,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm5,ISTPc,"he went on his computer,
and he bought 200 objects from eBay."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm6,ISTPc,"And the average price of the objects
was about one dollar."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm7,ISTPc,"He then called 200 authors,
and he asked them,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm8,ISTPc,"""Hey, would you like to be part
of the 'significant object study'?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm9,ISTPc,"Which means that I would like you
to write a story to one of the objects."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm10,ISTPc,And 200 authors said yes.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm11,ISTPc,"So there he had 200 objects,
he had 200 stories,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm12,ISTPc,"and I assume that it was
with nail-biting anticipation"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm13,ISTPc,"that he went on eBay again
with all the 200 objects."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm14,ISTPc,"Would there be a difference?
Would there be a change?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm15,ISTPc,Do you think there was a change?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm16,ISTPc,"One of the objects was this,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm17,ISTPc,this beautiful horse's head.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm18,ISTPc,There we go.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm19,ISTPc,The beautiful horse's head.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm20,ISTPc,"Now, this beautiful horse's head
was bought for 99¢"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm21,ISTPc,"and was sold, when the story
was added, for $62.95."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm22,ISTPc,(Laughter)
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm23,ISTPc,That is a slight increase of 6395%.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm24,ISTPc,"So, was this a one-off situation?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm25,ISTPc,"Not really,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm26,ISTPc,"because he bought the 200 objects
for a total of $129,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm27,ISTPc,selling them for $8000.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm28,ISTPc,"Now, that's insane."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm29,ISTPc,"But you know what's even more
intellectually challenging to understand?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm30,ISTPc,How can you and I
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm31,ISTPc,"go to the movies and pay good money
to watch movies like James Bond,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm32,ISTPc,[that] are absolutely unrealistic?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm33,ISTPc,"And we sit there;
we enjoy the movie."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm34,ISTPc,"And some of us, we really enjoy the movie."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm35,ISTPc,"And we leave the theater,
going like, ""God, what a man!"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm36,ISTPc,I would like to be more like him.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm37,ISTPc,"I'd like to walk like him.
I'd like to talk like him."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm38,ISTPc,I like Bond.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm39,ISTPc,(Laughter)
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm40,ISTPc,"I wonder how I could be more like Bond."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm41,ISTPc,"And then this weird revelation
hits you like from nowhere,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm42,ISTPc,"and you come up with a brilliant idea
to walk to a watchmaker shop."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm43,ISTPc,"And wow! It just happens
to be an Omega watch in that shop"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm44,ISTPc,"that resembles the one
that Bond was wearing in the movie."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm45,ISTPc,"And you pay $10,000
to put that watch on your wrist."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm46,ISTPc,"And you leave that store
feeling more like Bond."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm47,ISTPc,How is that possible?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm48,ISTPc,"PQ Media tells us
that 10.5 billion dollars"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm49,ISTPc,"is turned over in product placement
revenue every single year."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm50,ISTPc,"How is it possible for you
to be so easily tricked"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm51,ISTPc,by something so simple as a story?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm52,ISTPc,Because you are tricked.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm53,ISTPc,"Well, it all comes down to one core thing,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm54,ISTPc,and that is emotional investment.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm55,ISTPc,"The more emotionally invested you are
in anything in your life,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm56,ISTPc,"the less critical and the less
objectively observant you become."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm57,ISTPc,"And the greatest
emotional investment of all"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm58,ISTPc,is falling in love.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm59,ISTPc,"Now, falling in love
resembles a good story."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm60,ISTPc,"Do you remember
the last time you fell in love?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm61,ISTPc,"Yeah? Good for you.
It's a beautiful feeling, isn't it?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm62,ISTPc,(Laughter)

and how you yearned and how you dreamt?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm64,ISTPc,"Then you looked at her,

ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm65,ISTPc,"""God, I love the way you chew that apple -"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm66,ISTPc,so crunchy.

you fall out of love -"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm73,ISTPc,"suddenly you find yourself
sitting in the sofa, and you go,"

did this thing come from?"

ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm76,ISTPc,"This is a weird thing."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm77,ISTPc,"Then suddenly you hear a sound;
you go like, ""What's that?"""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm78,ISTPc,"You go over to the kitchen,
and you look, and you go like,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm79,ISTPc,"""Oh, it's you!
You're eating an apple there."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm80,ISTPc,"Could you just keep that down
just a little bit?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm81,ISTPc,You're kind of spraying the table there.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm82,ISTPc,"Please, please don't."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm83,ISTPc,"And you sit down comfortably again,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm84,ISTPc,"and just a minute later,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm85,ISTPc,"you hear somebody drinking tea
from the kitchen, going (Slurp)."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm86,ISTPc,"And suddenly, this is all annoying to you."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm87,ISTPc,Have you been there?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm88,ISTPc,"Sadly enough,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm89,ISTPc,"13 months later,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm90,ISTPc,"our critical thinking and our cortex
comes home from a one-year-long vacation,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm91,ISTPc,and we start questioning things.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm92,ISTPc,"During those 13 months, what happened
was that your brain was flooded"

hijacking your cortex,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm94,ISTPc,"throwing your objectively
observant skills out of the window."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm95,ISTPc,"And the thing with storytelling
is that the same thing can happen."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm96,ISTPc,"In stories, the same hormones
and neurotransmitters can be released."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm97,ISTPc,"Hormones like vasopressin, oxytocin,
serotonin, dopamine, endorphins."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm98,ISTPc,And you know what?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm99,ISTPc,"That's what I would like to do
during my talk."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm100,ISTPc,"I would like to induce
three hormones into your brain."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm101,ISTPc,"I call it ""the angels' cocktail,""
so it's a nice cocktail."

ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm104,ISTPc,Is it okay?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm105,ISTPc,Cool.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm106,ISTPc,"And if you don't like the idea of that,
you'll just have to cover your ears."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm107,ISTPc,"So, dopamine. This is what it looks like."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm108,ISTPc,"And when you have that in your blood,
these are the beautiful effects:"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm109,ISTPc,"you get more focus, more motivation,
and you remember things in a better way."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm110,ISTPc,"So what does dopamine feel like?
It feels like this."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm111,ISTPc,"About six years ago, I received

and I'm going to their office,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm120,ISTPc,"and just as I am going
to pull the handle down,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm121,ISTPc,what I don't know then
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm122,ISTPc,"is that I'm walking into
one of the absolute worst meetings"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm123,ISTPc,I'm ever going to have in my life.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm124,ISTPc,"But I don't know that yet, so it's okay."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm125,ISTPc,"I open the door, and I meet this woman."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm126,ISTPc,Her name is Liana.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm127,ISTPc,"And hurriedly she says,
""David, just so you know,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm128,ISTPc,"I'm not the one you're having
this meeting with;"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm129,ISTPc,"you're going to have it
with three gentlemen, further on here."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm130,ISTPc,"And I'm like, ""Okay,
that's a bit strange."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm131,ISTPc,"Usually you know who
you're going to have the meeting with."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm132,ISTPc,"Then she progresses
with a bit of chit-chatting,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm133,ISTPc,"and then suddenly she says,
""Are you ready now?"""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm134,ISTPc,"And I'm like, ""Yeah,
what should I be ready for?"""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm135,ISTPc,"She says, ""Just so you know -
Can you see the room over there?"""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm136,ISTPc,"And I go like, ""Yes, I can see it."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm137,ISTPc,"""Well, in that room
you have the three gentlemen."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm138,ISTPc,"Just so you know, they're all
majority owners of this company."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm139,ISTPc,"They've all got an ex-military background,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm140,ISTPc,"and none of them wants the training
that you are going to pitch."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm141,ISTPc,(Laughter)
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm142,ISTPc,"I'm like, ""Come on!"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm143,ISTPc,"Why am I here?"""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm144,ISTPc,"And it's like, ""Well,
all the trainers want this,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm145,ISTPc,but the management are on too high horses.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm146,ISTPc,They can't see that they need it.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm147,ISTPc,So it's pretty simple.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm148,ISTPc,"The only thing you have to do
is go in there and kind of, you know,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm149,ISTPc,"just prove the opposite."""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm150,ISTPc,"I'm like, ""Yeah, that sounds
simple, doesn't it?"""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm151,ISTPc,"And I can remember myself,
I'm walking towards this office,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm152,ISTPc,"my sweat is coming down
my palms, my heart is racing,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm153,ISTPc,"and just halfway there, she calls my name."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm154,ISTPc,"And I still, to this day,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm155,ISTPc,"don't know if this woman
is sadomasochistic"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm156,ISTPc,or just downright unintelligent.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm157,ISTPc,"Because she calls my name,
and she goes like, ""David!"""
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm158,ISTPc,"It's like I'm going to get the tip
or something like that,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm159,ISTPc,"so I turn around to ask her,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm160,ISTPc,and she says the following -
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm161,ISTPc,"And if I don't tell you
what she says there, is that annoying?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm162,ISTPc,(Laughter)
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm163,ISTPc,"Well, actually, as an example,
I'm not going to do that."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm164,ISTPc,"I just wanted to prove to you
what it feels with high dopamine levels."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm165,ISTPc,"Would you say that
your focus was increased?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm166,ISTPc,Your attention was increased?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm167,ISTPc,"You were creative;
you created situations around this,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm168,ISTPc,"and you probably already figured out
what that room looked like, correct?"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm169,ISTPc,"And you'll remember that I
did that to you for quite a while."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm170,ISTPc,"Now, the feeling you had there"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm171,ISTPc,"was high levels of dopamine,
which is beautiful."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm172,ISTPc,So how do you do that?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm173,ISTPc,"Well, what you do is you build suspense,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm174,ISTPc,"you launch a cliffhanger,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm175,ISTPc,and the most beautiful thing of all
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm176,ISTPc,"is that all storytelling is,
per definition, dopamine-creating"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm177,ISTPc,"because it's always something
that we're waiting and expecting."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm178,ISTPc,"So just imagine, just by using
storytelling you can get those techniques."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm179,ISTPc,"You don't have to do
a cliffhanger like I did."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm180,ISTPc,So that was the first hormone.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm181,ISTPc,I'd now like to go to oxytocin.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm182,ISTPc,Is that okay as well? I'll induce that?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm183,ISTPc,All right.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm184,ISTPc,"The beautiful effects
of oxytocin are the following:"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm185,ISTPc,"you become more generous,
you trust me more, and you bond to me."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm186,ISTPc,You want to do that?
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm187,ISTPc,All right.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm188,ISTPc,"All right, so this was a ..."
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm189,ISTPc,"Nine months had passed,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm190,ISTPc,and it was a planned caesarean.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm191,ISTPc,"And the little brother, who was
5 years of age at that point of time,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm192,ISTPc,"he was kind of really looking forward
to what's going to be -"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm193,ISTPc,what's going to happen.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm194,ISTPc,He was going to become a big brother.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm195,ISTPc,"And he had helped us
pick out the wallpaper,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm196,ISTPc,he'd helped choose the bed linen.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm197,ISTPc,"He'd even saved his own pocket money
to buy a little stuffed animal,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm198,ISTPc,which was placed on the pillowcase.
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm199,ISTPc,"About two days before
the planned cesarean,"
ISTPc_The magical science of storytelling | David JP Phillips | TEDxStockholm200,ISTPc,something happened.
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert0,ENTJ,[Music]
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert1,ENTJ,when you have 21 minutes to speak two
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert2,ENTJ,million years seems like a really long
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert3,ENTJ,time but evolutionarily two million
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert4,ENTJ,years is nothing and yet in two million
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert5,ENTJ,years the human brain has nearly tripled
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert6,ENTJ,in mass going from the one and a quarter
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert7,ENTJ,pound brain of our ancestor here habilis
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert8,ENTJ,to the almost three pound meatloaf that
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert9,ENTJ,everybody here has between their ears
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert10,ENTJ,what is it about a big brain that nature
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert11,ENTJ,was so eager for Everyone us to have one
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert12,ENTJ,well it turns out when brings triple in
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert13,ENTJ,size they don't just get three times
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert14,ENTJ,bigger they gain new structures and one
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert15,ENTJ,of the main reasons that our brain got
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert16,ENTJ,so big is because it got a new part
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert17,ENTJ,called the frontal lobe and particularly
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert18,ENTJ,a part called the prefrontal cortex now
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert19,ENTJ,what does the prefrontal cortex do for
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert20,ENTJ,you that should justify the entire
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert21,ENTJ,architectural overhaul of the human
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert22,ENTJ,skull in the blink of evolutionary time
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert23,ENTJ,well turns out the prefrontal cortex
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert24,ENTJ,does lots of things but one of the most
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert25,ENTJ,important things it does is it is an
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert26,ENTJ,experience simulator
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert27,ENTJ,you know flight pilots practice in
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert28,ENTJ,flight simulators so that they don't
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert29,ENTJ,make real mistakes and planes human
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert30,ENTJ,beings have this marvelous adaptation
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert31,ENTJ,that they can actually have experiences
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert32,ENTJ,in their heads before they try them out
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert33,ENTJ,in real life this is a trick that none
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert34,ENTJ,of our ancestors could do that no other
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert35,ENTJ,animal can do quite like we can it's a
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert36,ENTJ,marvellous adaptation it's up there with
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert37,ENTJ,opposable thumbs and standing upright
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert38,ENTJ,and language as one of the things that
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert39,ENTJ,got our species out of the trees and
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert40,ENTJ,into the shopping mall now all of you
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert41,ENTJ,have done this I mean you know Ben and
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert42,ENTJ,Jerry's doesn't have liver in onion ice
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert43,ENTJ,cream and it's not because they whipped
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert44,ENTJ,some up tried it and went yuck
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert45,ENTJ,it's because from without leaving your
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert46,ENTJ,armchair you can simulate that flavor
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert47,ENTJ,and say yuck before you make it let's
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert48,ENTJ,see how your experience simulators are
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert49,ENTJ,working let's just run a quick
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert50,ENTJ,diagnostic before I proceed with the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert51,ENTJ,rest of the talk here's two different
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert52,ENTJ,futures that I invite you to contemplate
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert53,ENTJ,and you can try to simulate them and
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert54,ENTJ,tell me which one you think you
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert55,ENTJ,might prefer one of them is winning the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert56,ENTJ,lottery this is about 314 million
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert57,ENTJ,dollars and the other is becoming
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert58,ENTJ,paraplegic
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert59,ENTJ,so just given a moment of thought you
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert60,ENTJ,probably don't feel like you need a
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert61,ENTJ,moment of thought and interestingly
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert62,ENTJ,there are data on these two groups of
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert63,ENTJ,people data on how happy they are and
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert64,ENTJ,this is exactly what you expected isn't
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert65,ENTJ,it but these aren't the data
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert66,ENTJ,I made these up these are the data you
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert67,ENTJ,failed the pop quiz in your hardly five
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert68,ENTJ,minutes into the lecture because the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert69,ENTJ,fact is that a year after losing the use
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert70,ENTJ,of their legs and a year after winning
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert71,ENTJ,the lotto lottery winners and
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert72,ENTJ,paraplegics are equally happy with their
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert73,ENTJ,lives now don't feel too bad about
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert74,ENTJ,failing the first pop quiz because
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert75,ENTJ,everybody fails all of the pop quizzes
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert76,ENTJ,all of the time the research that my
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert77,ENTJ,laboratory has been doing that
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert78,ENTJ,economists and psychologists around the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert79,ENTJ,country have been doing have revealed
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert80,ENTJ,something really quite startling to us
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert81,ENTJ,something we call the impact bias which
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert82,ENTJ,is the tendency for the simulator to
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert83,ENTJ,work badly for the simulator to make you
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert84,ENTJ,believe that different outcomes are more
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert85,ENTJ,different than in fact they really are
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert86,ENTJ,from field studies to laboratory studies
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert87,ENTJ,we see that winning or losing an
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert88,ENTJ,election gaining or losing a romantic
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert89,ENTJ,partner getting or not getting a
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert90,ENTJ,promotion passing or not passing a
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert91,ENTJ,college test on and on have far less
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert92,ENTJ,impact less intensity and much less
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert93,ENTJ,duration that people expect them to have
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert94,ENTJ,effect a recent study this almost fleurs
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert95,ENTJ,me a recent study showing how major life
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert96,ENTJ,traumas affect people suggests that if
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert97,ENTJ,it happened over three months ago with
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert98,ENTJ,only a few exceptions it has no impact
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert99,ENTJ,whatsoever on your happiness why because
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert100,ENTJ,happiness can be synthesized
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert101,ENTJ,Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642 I am the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert102,ENTJ,happiest man alive I have that in me
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert103,ENTJ,that can convert poverty to riches
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert104,ENTJ,adversity to prosperity I am more in
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert105,ENTJ,vulnerable than Achilles fortune hath
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert106,ENTJ,not one place to hit me kind of
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert107,ENTJ,remarkable machinery does this guy have
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert108,ENTJ,in his head well it turns out it's
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert109,ENTJ,precisely the same remarkable motion
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert110,ENTJ,that all of us have human beings have
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert111,ENTJ,something that we might think of as a
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert112,ENTJ,psychological immune system a system of
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert113,ENTJ,cognitive processes largely non
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert114,ENTJ,conscious cognitive processes that help
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert115,ENTJ,them change their views of the world so
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert116,ENTJ,that they can feel better about the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert117,ENTJ,worlds in which they find themselves
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert118,ENTJ,like Sir Thomas you have this machine on
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert119,ENTJ,like Sir Thomas you seem not to know it
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert120,ENTJ,we synthesize happiness but we think
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert121,ENTJ,happiness is a thing to be found now you
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert122,ENTJ,don't need me to tell you give you too
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert123,ENTJ,many examples of people synthesizing
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert124,ENTJ,happiness I suspect though I'm gonna
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert125,ENTJ,show you some experimental evidence you
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert126,ENTJ,don't have to look very far for evidence
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert127,ENTJ,I as a challenge to myself since I say
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert128,ENTJ,this once in a while in lectures I took
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert129,ENTJ,a copy of the New York Times and tried
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert130,ENTJ,to find some instances of people
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert131,ENTJ,synthesizing happiness and here are
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert132,ENTJ,three guys synthesizing happiness I'm so
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert133,ENTJ,much better off physically financially
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert134,ENTJ,emotionally in almost every other way
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert135,ENTJ,mentally almost every other way and I'm
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert136,ENTJ,a 1 minutes regret it was a glorious
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert137,ENTJ,experience I believe it turned out for
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert138,ENTJ,the best who are these characters who
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert139,ENTJ,are so damn happy well the first one is
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert140,ENTJ,Jim Wright some of you are old enough to
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert141,ENTJ,remember he was the chairman of the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert142,ENTJ,House of Representatives and he resigned
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert143,ENTJ,in disgrace when this young Republican
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert144,ENTJ,named Newt Gingrich found out about a
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert145,ENTJ,shady book deal he had done he lost
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert146,ENTJ,everything most powerful Democrat in the
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert147,ENTJ,country lost everything lost his money
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert148,ENTJ,lost his power what does he have to say
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert149,ENTJ,all these years later about it I am so
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert150,ENTJ,much better off physically financially
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert151,ENTJ,mentally in almost every other way what
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert152,ENTJ,other way would there be to be better
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert153,ENTJ,off vegetable e minerally animal e he's
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert154,ENTJ,pretty much covered in there
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert155,ENTJ,Maurice victim is somebody you've never
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert156,ENTJ,heard of Maurice victim uttered these
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert157,ENTJ,words upon being released he was 78
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert158,ENTJ,years old he'd spent 37 years in
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert159,ENTJ,Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert160,ENTJ,he didn't commit he was ultimately
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert161,ENTJ,exonerated at the age of 78 through DNA
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert162,ENTJ,evidence and what did he have to say
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert163,ENTJ,about his experience I don't have one
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert164,ENTJ,minutes regret it was a glorious
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert165,ENTJ,experience glorious this guy is not
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert166,ENTJ,saying why are some nice guys there too
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert167,ENTJ,Jim its glorious a word we usually
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert168,ENTJ,reserved for something like a religious
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert169,ENTJ,experience Harriet's Langerman uttered
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert170,ENTJ,these words and he's somebody you might
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert171,ENTJ,have known but
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert172,ENTJ,because in 1949 he read a little article
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert173,ENTJ,in the paper about a hamburger stand
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert174,ENTJ,owned by these two brothers named
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert175,ENTJ,McDonald's and he thought that's a
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert176,ENTJ,really neat idea so he went to find them
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert177,ENTJ,they said we'd give you a franchise on
ENTJ_The surprising science of happiness | Dan Gilbert178,ENTJ,this for three thousand bucks Harry went

INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #50,INTJc,"SIRAJ:
-Hello World, it's Siraj!"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #51,INTJc,"In this video, we're gonna create a neural network"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #52,INTJc,that makes images become really trippy
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #53,INTJc,using Python and TensorFlow.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #54,INTJc,We humans have been using psychedelic drugs
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #55,INTJc,since prehistoric time.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #56,INTJc,-That wasn't a normal mushroom!
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #57,INTJc,They help manifest parts of our mind
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #58,INTJc,to conscious experience that wouldn't normally otherwise.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #59,INTJc,One of the most common experiences
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #510,INTJc,from psychedelics are trippy visuals.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #511,INTJc,People who have taken psychedelics
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #512,INTJc,repeatedly describe experiences of seeing
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #513,INTJc,both open-eyed and closed-eyed visuals.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #514,INTJc,But how? What are these drugs doing in our brain
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #515,INTJc,that makes us see things that aren't really there?
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #516,INTJc,The traditional way for us to find out
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #517,INTJc,is to test live human subjects tripping balls
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #518,INTJc,"under an fMRI machine,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #519,INTJc,"but recently, we've gotten artificial neural networks"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #520,INTJc,"that do the same thing,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #521,INTJc,Google trained a neural network
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #522,INTJc,on a labeled dataset of images --
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #523,INTJc,everything from squirrels to temples --
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #524,INTJc,"and as it trained on these images,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #525,INTJc,it built internal representations at each layer.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #526,INTJc,"Eventually, the first two layers learned low-level features"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #527,INTJc,"like lines and edges, and they got progressively more abstract"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #528,INTJc,so the last few layers were representations
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #529,INTJc,for faces and big shapes.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #530,INTJc,So when we visualize one of
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #531,INTJc,"the higher-level representations it built,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #532,INTJc,we can see that it contains a mixture of features
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #533,INTJc,like the eyes of a dog and the head of a bird.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #534,INTJc,Eugh!
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #535,INTJc,And when they gave it a novel image
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #536,INTJc,and asked not to classify it
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #537,INTJc,but to maximize the similarity between the image
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #538,INTJc,"and a representation at a particular layer,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #539,INTJc,the result was a very trippy image.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #540,INTJc,It all sounds very similar to the drug experience
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #541,INTJc,which is insane.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #542,INTJc,Our brains are carbon-based
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #543,INTJc,and they use chemical signals as messengers.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #544,INTJc,A neural network doesn't even exist
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #545,INTJc,in physical space at all.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #546,INTJc,It's an abstract concept being represented
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #547,INTJc,on binary silicon transistors.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #548,INTJc,There's no reason to expect that these two systems
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #549,INTJc,would develop the same mechanism
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #550,INTJc,for processing visual information.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #551,INTJc,"Even with existing similarities,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #552,INTJc,natural selection is very different from using
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #553,INTJc,gradient descent to alter weights
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #554,INTJc,of connection between nodes.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #555,INTJc,"Could it be that, somehow,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #556,INTJc,encoded in the fundamental rules of the universe
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #557,INTJc,there's this ideal way of doing object recognition?
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #558,INTJc,"TRINITY:
-What is he doing?"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #559,INTJc,"MORPHEUS:
-He's beginning to believe."
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #560,INTJc,"SIRAJ (AS NEO):
-You're damn right, Morpheus."
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #561,INTJc,"-We're getting closer to understanding it every day,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #562,INTJc,and we can learn a lot about the brain
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #563,INTJc,"including human development,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #564,INTJc,"treatment for cognitive disabilities, and drug effects,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #565,INTJc,from studying artificial neural networks.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #566,INTJc,"After we install our dependencies,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #567,INTJc,we're gonna replicate Google's Deep Dream code
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #568,INTJc,"in TensorFlow, and then test it out on a novel image."
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #569,INTJc,NumPy will be used to perform math calculations.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #570,INTJc,The 'partial' submodule of functools
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #571,INTJc,lets us create new versions of functions
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #572,INTJc,with one or more arguments filled in.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #573,INTJc,"This is good for reusability,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #574,INTJc,which means less code to write.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #575,INTJc,"Pillow is an imaging library,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #576,INTJc,and Image will help us modify our images.

INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #583,INTJc,Our imports are already at the top of our script
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #584,INTJc,so we're going to download
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #585,INTJc,"Google's pre-trained neural network,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #586,INTJc,"create a TensorFlow session,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #587,INTJc,pick a layer and a pre-trained network

INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #589,INTJc,"apply our gradient ascent to that layer repeatedly,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #590,INTJc,and then output our newly Deep Dream'd image.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #591,INTJc,Let's start by downloading
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #592,INTJc,"Google's pre-trained neural network called ""Inception"""
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #593,INTJc,in our main() method.

INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #595,INTJc,"create a data directory where we will extract it to,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #596,INTJc,then use the os module to retrieve the model name
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #597,INTJc,and create a local ZIP file path.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #598,INTJc,"If there is nothing at that path,"

INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5100,INTJc,with the 'url' variable as a parameter
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5101,INTJc,and store it in the 'model_url' variable.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5102,INTJc,We'll open our ZIP file with the 'wb' flag
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5103,INTJc,"so we can write to it in binary,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5104,INTJc,then write the downloaded data to it.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5105,INTJc,Then we'll extract that using the ZipFile module.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5106,INTJc,Now we can create our TensorFlow session.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5107,INTJc,We'll load our Inception graph file
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5108,INTJc,"into our 'model_fn' variable, then initialize the graph"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5109,INTJc,using the Graph() function of TensorFlow.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5110,INTJc,Now we can initialize a session using that graph.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5111,INTJc,We'll open our existing saved-in-session graph
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5112,INTJc,using the FastGFile() function
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5113,INTJc,and point it to the saved graph.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5114,INTJc,"Once we've opened it, we can read that graph"

INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5117,INTJc,of TensorFlow's graph definition module.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5118,INTJc,"We need to define our input, so we'll create"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5119,INTJc,an input tensor using the placeholder() method
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5120,INTJc,called 'input' with the size of 32 bits.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5121,INTJc,Then we'll define image net mean value of pixels
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5122,INTJc,in an image as 117.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5123,INTJc,"By removing this value from our image,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5124,INTJc,"it will help us with feature learning,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5125,INTJc,so we will subtract it from our input tensor
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5126,INTJc,and store the value in our 'preprocessed' variable.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5127,INTJc,Then we'll load the 'graph_def' variable we initialized
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5128,INTJc,with the input as the newly processed tensor.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5129,INTJc,"So now we've got our TensorFlow model,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5130,INTJc,"we've downloaded from the web,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5131,INTJc,and we've loaded it into our session
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5132,INTJc,as a graph with a bunch of layers.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5133,INTJc,"It's a convolutional neural network,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5134,INTJc,the type of neural net that helps recognize images.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5135,INTJc,Let's load all those layers into an array
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5136,INTJc,and store them in our 'layers' object.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5137,INTJc,"So for every TensorFlow operation in our graph,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5138,INTJc,"if it's a convolutional layer, load it into our array."
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5139,INTJc,So we've got
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5140,INTJc,"♫ layers, lay-layers, lay- ♫"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5141,INTJc,"Yeah, we're balling hard right now, I know."
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5142,INTJc,"OK, so each of our convolutional layers"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5143,INTJc,output tens of hundreds of feature channels
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5144,INTJc,"to pass data in the graph,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5145,INTJc,and we can collect them all
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5146,INTJc,and store them in the 'feature_nums' variable.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5147,INTJc,Let's print them out and visualize what we've got
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5148,INTJc,in terminal first.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5149,INTJc,We can see our number of layers
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5150,INTJc,and the total number of feature channels right here.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5151,INTJc,Let's now pick a layer from our model
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5152,INTJc,that we're going to enhance.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5153,INTJc,We'll pick a lower-level layer
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5154,INTJc,and pick one of the feature channels to visualize.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5155,INTJc,It's time to load our input image
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5156,INTJc,using the Pillow Image submodule's open() method
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5157,INTJc,and store it in our image variable.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5158,INTJc,We'll format it accordingly using NumPy
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5159,INTJc,and perform Deep Dream on it
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5160,INTJc,with our render_deepdream() function
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5161,INTJc,with a focus on the layer we selected earlier.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5162,INTJc,"In our Deep Dream function,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5163,INTJc,we can see a couple of our predefined hyperparameters.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5164,INTJc,"We'll start by defining our optimization objective,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5165,INTJc,which is to reduce the mean of our input layer.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5166,INTJc,The gradients() function lets us compute
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5167,INTJc,the symbolic gradient of our optimized tensor
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5168,INTJc,with respect to our input tensor.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5169,INTJc,Now we can split our image into a number of octaves
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5170,INTJc,"and say for each octave, let's resize it using NumPy"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5171,INTJc,and add it to our array of image octaves.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5172,INTJc,Then we can generate details octave by octave
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5173,INTJc,by iterating through each.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5174,INTJc,Random shapes are applied to the image
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5175,INTJc,to blur tile boundaries over multiple iterations
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5176,INTJc,using the calc_grad_tiled() function.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5177,INTJc,We're essentially applying gradient ascent here
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5178,INTJc,"to maximize our loss function,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5179,INTJc,which merges our saved representation
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5180,INTJc,in this layer with our input image
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5181,INTJc,more and more every iteration.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5182,INTJc,"So to break it down,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5183,INTJc,neural networks are a great test for learning
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5184,INTJc,about how the brain functions
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5185,INTJc,and responds to certain stimuli.
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5186,INTJc,They store increasingly abstract representations
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5187,INTJc,"of what they learn in their layers,"
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5188,INTJc,and we can create trippy images
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5189,INTJc,by applying a gradient ascent process to them
INTJc_Deep Dream in TensorFlow - Learn Python for Data Science #5190,INTJc,based on any chosen layer

INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker32,INTJc,and you can't absorb new memories.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker33,INTJc,So let me show you the data.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker34,INTJc,"Here in this study, we decided
to test the hypothesis"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker35,INTJc,"that pulling the all-nighter
was a good idea."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker36,INTJc,So we took a group of individuals
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker37,INTJc,"and we assigned them
to one of two experimental groups:"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker38,INTJc,"a sleep group
and a sleep deprivation group."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker39,INTJc,"Now the sleep group, they're going to get
a full eight hours of slumber,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker40,INTJc,"but the deprivation group,
we're going to keep them awake"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker41,INTJc,"in the laboratory, under full supervision."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker42,INTJc,"There's no naps or caffeine, by the way,
so it's miserable for everyone involved."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker43,INTJc,"And then the next day,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker44,INTJc,"we're going to place those participants
inside an MRI scanner"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker45,INTJc,"and we're going to have them
try and learn a whole list of new facts"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker46,INTJc,"as we're taking snapshots
of brain activity."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker47,INTJc,And then we're going to test them
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker48,INTJc,"to see how effective
that learning has been."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker49,INTJc,"And that's what you're looking at
here on the vertical axis."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker50,INTJc,"And when you put
those two groups head to head,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker51,INTJc,"what you find is a quite significant,
40-percent deficit"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker52,INTJc,"in the ability of the brain
to make new memories without sleep."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker53,INTJc,"I think this should be concerning,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker54,INTJc,"considering what we know
is happening to sleep"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker55,INTJc,in our education populations right now.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker56,INTJc,"In fact, to put that in context,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker57,INTJc,"it would be the difference
in a child acing an exam"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker58,INTJc,versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker59,INTJc,"And we've gone on to discover
what goes wrong within your brain"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker60,INTJc,"to produce these types
of learning disabilities."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker61,INTJc,And there's a structure that sits
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker62,INTJc,"on the left and the right side
of your brain, called the hippocampus."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker63,INTJc,And you can think of the hippocampus
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker64,INTJc,"almost like the informational
inbox of your brain."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker65,INTJc,"It's very good at receiving
new memory files"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker66,INTJc,and then holding on to them.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker67,INTJc,And when you look at this structure
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker68,INTJc,"in those people who'd had
a full night of sleep,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker69,INTJc,"we saw lots of healthy
learning-related activity."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker70,INTJc,"Yet in those people
who were sleep-deprived,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker71,INTJc,"we actually couldn't find
any significant signal whatsoever."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker72,INTJc,"So it's almost as though sleep deprivation
had shut down your memory inbox,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker73,INTJc,"and any new incoming files --
they were just being bounced."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker74,INTJc,"You couldn't effectively
commit new experiences to memory."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker75,INTJc,"So that's the bad that can happen
if I were to take sleep away from you,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker76,INTJc,"but let me just come back
to that control group for a second."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker77,INTJc,"Do you remember those folks
that got a full eight hours of sleep?"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker78,INTJc,"Well, we can ask
a very different question:"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker79,INTJc,"What is it about the physiological
quality of your sleep"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker80,INTJc,when you do get it
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker81,INTJc,"that restores and enhances
your memory and learning ability"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker82,INTJc,each and every day?
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker83,INTJc,"And by placing electrodes
all over the head,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker84,INTJc,"what we've discovered
is that there are big, powerful brainwaves"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker85,INTJc,"that happen during
the very deepest stages of sleep"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker86,INTJc,that have riding on top of them
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker87,INTJc,"these spectacular bursts
of electrical activity"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker88,INTJc,that we call sleep spindles.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker89,INTJc,"And it's the combined quality
of these deep-sleep brainwaves"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker90,INTJc,"that acts like a file-transfer
mechanism at night,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker91,INTJc,"shifting memories from a short-term
vulnerable reservoir"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker92,INTJc,"to a more permanent long-term
storage site within the brain,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker93,INTJc,"and therefore protecting them,
making them safe."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker94,INTJc,And it is important that we understand
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker95,INTJc,"what during sleep actually transacts
these memory benefits,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker96,INTJc,"because there are real medical
and societal implications."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker97,INTJc,And let me just tell you about one area
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker98,INTJc,"that we've moved this work
out into, clinically,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker99,INTJc,"which is the context of aging
and dementia."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker100,INTJc,"Because it's of course no secret
that, as we get older,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker101,INTJc,"our learning and memory abilities
begin to fade and decline."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker102,INTJc,But what we've also discovered
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker103,INTJc,"is that a physiological signature of aging
is that your sleep gets worse,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker104,INTJc,"especially that deep quality of sleep
that I was just discussing."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker105,INTJc,"And only last year,
we finally published evidence"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker106,INTJc,"that these two things,
they're not simply co-occurring,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker107,INTJc,they are significantly interrelated.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker108,INTJc,"And it suggests
that the disruption of deep sleep"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker109,INTJc,is an underappreciated factor
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker110,INTJc,"that is contributing
to cognitive decline or memory decline"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker111,INTJc,"in aging, and most recently
we've discovered,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker112,INTJc,in Alzheimer's disease as well.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker113,INTJc,"Now, I know this is remarkably
depressing news."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker114,INTJc,It's in the mail. It's coming at you.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker115,INTJc,"But there's a potential
silver lining here."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker116,INTJc,"Unlike many of the other factors
that we know are associated with aging,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker117,INTJc,"for example changes
in the physical structure of the brain,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker118,INTJc,that's fiendishly difficult to treat.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker119,INTJc,"But that sleep is a missing piece
in the explanatory puzzle"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker120,INTJc,of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker121,INTJc,"because we may be able
to do something about it."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker122,INTJc,"And one way that we are
approaching this at my sleep center"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker123,INTJc,"is not by using
sleeping pills, by the way."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker124,INTJc,"Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments
that do not produce naturalistic sleep."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker125,INTJc,"Instead, we're actually developing
a method based on this."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker126,INTJc,"It's called direct current
brain stimulation."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker127,INTJc,"You insert a small amount
of voltage into the brain,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker128,INTJc,"so small you typically don't feel it,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker129,INTJc,but it has a measurable impact.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker130,INTJc,"Now if you apply this stimulation
during sleep in young, healthy adults,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker131,INTJc,"as if you're sort of singing in time
with those deep-sleep brainwaves,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker132,INTJc,"not only can you amplify
the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker133,INTJc,"but in doing so, we can almost
double the amount of memory benefit"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker134,INTJc,that you get from sleep.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker135,INTJc,"The question now
is whether we can translate"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker136,INTJc,"this same affordable,
potentially portable piece of technology"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker137,INTJc,into older adults and those with dementia.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker138,INTJc,"Can we restore back
some healthy quality of deep sleep,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker139,INTJc,"and in doing so, can we salvage
aspects of their learning"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker140,INTJc,and memory function?
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker141,INTJc,That is my real hope now.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker142,INTJc,"That's one of our moon-shot
goals, as it were."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker143,INTJc,"So that's an example
of sleep for your brain,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker144,INTJc,"but sleep is just
as essential for your body."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker145,INTJc,"We've already spoken about sleep loss
and your reproductive system."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker146,INTJc,"Or I could tell you about sleep loss
and your cardiovascular system,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker147,INTJc,and that all it takes is one hour.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker148,INTJc,"Because there is a global experiment
performed on 1.6 billion people"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker149,INTJc,"across 70 countries twice a year,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker150,INTJc,and it's called daylight saving time.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker151,INTJc,"Now, in the spring,
when we lose one hour of sleep,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker152,INTJc,"we see a subsequent 24-percent increase
in heart attacks that following day."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker153,INTJc,"In the autumn,
when we gain an hour of sleep,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker154,INTJc,"we see a 21-percent
reduction in heart attacks."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker155,INTJc,Isn't that incredible?
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker156,INTJc,"And you see exactly the same profile
for car crashes, road traffic accidents,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker157,INTJc,even suicide rates.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker158,INTJc,"But as a deeper dive,
I want to focus on this:"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker159,INTJc,sleep loss and your immune system.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker160,INTJc,"And here, I'll introduce these delightful
blue elements in the image."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker161,INTJc,"They are called natural killer cells,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker162,INTJc,"and you can think of natural killer cells
almost like the secret service agents"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker163,INTJc,of your immune system.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker164,INTJc,"They are very good at identifying
dangerous, unwanted elements"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker165,INTJc,and eliminating them.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker166,INTJc,"In fact, what they're doing here
is destroying a cancerous tumor mass."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker167,INTJc,"So what you wish for
is a virile set of these immune assassins"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker168,INTJc,"at all times,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker169,INTJc,"and tragically, that's what you don't have
if you're not sleeping enough."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker170,INTJc,"So here in this experiment,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker171,INTJc,"you're not going to have your sleep
deprived for an entire night,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker172,INTJc,"you're simply going to have your sleep
restricted to four hours"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker173,INTJc,"for one single night,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker174,INTJc,"and then we're going to look to see
what's the percent reduction"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker175,INTJc,in immune cell activity that you suffer.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker176,INTJc,"And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker177,INTJc,it's not 20 percent.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker178,INTJc,"There was a 70-percent drop
in natural killer cell activity."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker179,INTJc,"That's a concerning state
of immune deficiency,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker180,INTJc,"and you can perhaps understand
why we're now finding"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker181,INTJc,"significant links between
short sleep duration"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker182,INTJc,"and your risk for the development
of numerous forms of cancer."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker183,INTJc,"Currently, that list includes
cancer of the bowel,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker184,INTJc,"cancer of the prostate
and cancer of the breast."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker185,INTJc,"In fact, the link between a lack of sleep
and cancer is now so strong"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker186,INTJc,that the World Health Organization
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker187,INTJc,"has classified any form
of nighttime shift work"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker188,INTJc,"as a probable carcinogen,"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker189,INTJc,"because of a disruption
of your sleep-wake rhythms."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker190,INTJc,So you may have heard of that old maxim
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker191,INTJc,that you can sleep when you're dead.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker192,INTJc,"Well, I'm being quite serious now --"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker193,INTJc,it is mortally unwise advice.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker194,INTJc,"We know this from epidemiological studies
across millions of individuals."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker195,INTJc,There's a simple truth:
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker196,INTJc,"the shorter your sleep,
the shorter your life."
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker197,INTJc,Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker198,INTJc,"And if increasing your risk
for the development of cancer"
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker199,INTJc,or even Alzheimer's disease
INTJc_Sleep is your superpower | Matt Walker200,INTJc,"were not sufficiently disquieting,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy0,ESTJ,"Eight years ago, I was haunted
by an evil spirit."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy1,ESTJ,"I was 25 at the time,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy2,ESTJ,"and I was living in a tiny house
behind someone else's house"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy3,ESTJ,in Los Angeles.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy4,ESTJ,"It was this guest house,
it had kind of been dilapidated,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy5,ESTJ,not taken care of for a long time.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy6,ESTJ,"And one night, I was sitting there"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy7,ESTJ,"and I got this really spooky feeling,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy8,ESTJ,"kind of the feeling
like you're being watched."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy9,ESTJ,"But no one was there except my two dogs,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy10,ESTJ,and they were just chewing their feet.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy11,ESTJ,And I looked around. No one was there.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy12,ESTJ,"And I thought, OK,
it's just my imagination."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy13,ESTJ,"But the feeling just kept getting worse,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy14,ESTJ,"and I started to feel
this pressure in my chest,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy15,ESTJ,"sort of like the feeling
when you get bad news."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy16,ESTJ,But it started to sink lower and lower
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy17,ESTJ,and almost hurt.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy18,ESTJ,"And over the course of that week,
this feeling got worse and worse,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy19,ESTJ,"and I started to become convinced
that something was there"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy20,ESTJ,"in my little guest house, haunting me."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy21,ESTJ,"And I started to hear these sounds,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy22,ESTJ,"this ""whoosh,"" kind of whisper,
like something passing through me."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy23,ESTJ,"I called my best friend, Claire, and said,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy24,ESTJ,"""I know this is going to sound crazy,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy25,ESTJ,"but, um ..."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy26,ESTJ,"I think there's a ghost in my house,
and I need to get rid of it."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy27,ESTJ,"And she said -- she's very
open-minded -- and she said,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy28,ESTJ,"""I don't think you're crazy."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy29,ESTJ,"I think you just need
to do a cleansing ritual."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy30,ESTJ,(Laughter)
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy31,ESTJ,"""So get some sage and burn it,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy32,ESTJ,"and tell it to go away."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy33,ESTJ,"So I said, ""OK,""
and I went and I bought sage."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy34,ESTJ,"I had never done this before,
so I set the sage on fire,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy35,ESTJ,"waved it about, and said, ""Go away!
This is my house! I live here."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy36,ESTJ,"You don't live here!"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy37,ESTJ,"But the feeling stayed.
Nothing got better."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy38,ESTJ,"And then I started to think,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy39,ESTJ,"OK, well now this thing is probably
just laughing at me,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy40,ESTJ,"because it hasn't left,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy41,ESTJ,"and I probably just look like
this impotent, powerless thing"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy42,ESTJ,that couldn't get it to go away.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy43,ESTJ,So every day I'd come home
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy44,ESTJ,"and you guys, this feeling got so bad
that -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now --"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy45,ESTJ,"but I would sit there in bed
and cry every night."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy46,ESTJ,"And the feeling on my chest
got worse and worse."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy47,ESTJ,It was physically painful.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy48,ESTJ,And I even went to a psychiatrist
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy49,ESTJ,"and tried to get her
to prescribe me medicine,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy50,ESTJ,"and she wouldn't just because
I don't have schizophrenia, OK."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy51,ESTJ,(Laughter)
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy52,ESTJ,"So finally I got on the internet,
and I Googled ""hauntings."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy53,ESTJ,"And I came upon this forum
of ghost hunters."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy54,ESTJ,"But these were a special
kind of ghost hunters --"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy55,ESTJ,they were skeptics.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy56,ESTJ,"They believed that every case of ghosts
that they had investigated so far"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy57,ESTJ,had been explained away by science.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy58,ESTJ,"And I was like, ""OK, smart guys,
this is what's happening to me,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy59,ESTJ,"and if you have an explanation for me,
I would love to hear it."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy60,ESTJ,"And one of them said, ""OK."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy61,ESTJ,"Um, have you heard
of carbon monoxide poisoning?"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy62,ESTJ,"And I said, ""Yeah."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy63,ESTJ,"Like, gas poisoning?"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy64,ESTJ,"Carbon monoxide poisoning
is when you have a gas leak"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy65,ESTJ,leaking into your home.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy66,ESTJ,"I looked it up, and the symptoms
of carbon monoxide poisoning"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy67,ESTJ,"include a pressure on your chest,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy68,ESTJ,auditory hallucinations -- whoosh --
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy69,ESTJ,and an unexplained feeling of dread.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy70,ESTJ,"So that night, I called the gas company."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy71,ESTJ,"I said, ""I have an emergency.
I need you to come out."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy72,ESTJ,"I don't want to get into the story now,
but I need you to come out."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy73,ESTJ,(Laughter)
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy74,ESTJ,"They came out. I said,
""I suspect a gas leak."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy75,ESTJ,"They brought their carbon
monoxide detector,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy76,ESTJ,"and the man said,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy77,ESTJ,"""It's a really good thing
that you called us tonight,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy78,ESTJ,"because you could have been
dead very soon."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy79,ESTJ,"Thirty-seven percent of Americans
believe in haunted houses,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy80,ESTJ,"and I wonder how many of them
have been in one"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy81,ESTJ,and how many of them have been in danger.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy82,ESTJ,"So that haunting story
has led me to my job."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy83,ESTJ,"I'm an investigator, and I'm
an investigator in two senses:"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy84,ESTJ,"I'm an investigative journalist,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy85,ESTJ,"and I'm also an investigator
of the claims of the paranormal"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy86,ESTJ,and claims of the spiritual.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy87,ESTJ,And that means a few things.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy88,ESTJ,"Sometimes that means that I'm pretending
to need an exorcism"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy89,ESTJ,"so I can get -- yes, that's right! --
so I can go to an exorcist"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy90,ESTJ,"and see if he's using gimmicks
or psychological tricks"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy91,ESTJ,"to try to convince someone
that they're possessed."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy92,ESTJ,"Sometimes that means
I'm going undercover in a fringe group"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy93,ESTJ,"which I report on
for a podcast that I co-host."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy94,ESTJ,"And I've done over 70 investigations
like this with my co-host, Ross."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy95,ESTJ,"I would love to tell you
that nine times out of 10, science wins,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy96,ESTJ,"saves the day, it's all explained."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy97,ESTJ,That's not true.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy98,ESTJ,"The truth is, 10 times out of 10,
science wins, it saves the day."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy99,ESTJ,(Applause)
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy100,ESTJ,"And that doesn't mean
there's no such thing as a mystery."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy101,ESTJ,"Of course there are mysteries,
but a mystery is a mystery."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy102,ESTJ,It is not a ghost.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy103,ESTJ,"Now, I believe there are
two kinds of truth,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy104,ESTJ,"and it's taken me a while to get
to this place, but I think this is right,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy105,ESTJ,so hear me out.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy106,ESTJ,"I think there is outer truth
and there's inner truth."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy107,ESTJ,"So if you say to me,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy108,ESTJ,"""There was a man named Jesus
and he once existed,"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy109,ESTJ,"that's outer truth, right?"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy110,ESTJ,"And we can go and look
at the historical record."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy111,ESTJ,"We can determine
whether that seems to be true."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy112,ESTJ,"And I would argue,
it does seem to be true."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy113,ESTJ,"If you say, ""Jesus rose
from the dead,"" -- ooh, trickier."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy114,ESTJ,(Laughter)
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy115,ESTJ,"I would say that's an outer-truth claim,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy116,ESTJ,because he physically rose or he didn't.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy117,ESTJ,"I'm not going to get into
whether he rose or he didn't,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy118,ESTJ,"but I would say
that's an outer-truth claim."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy119,ESTJ,It happened or it didn't happen.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy120,ESTJ,"But if you say, ""I don't care
whether he rose from the dead."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy121,ESTJ,"It's symbolically important to me,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy122,ESTJ,"and that metaphor is so meaningful,
so purposeful to me,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy123,ESTJ,"and I'm not going to try
to persuade you of it,"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy124,ESTJ,"now you've moved it
from outer truth to inner truth,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy125,ESTJ,from science to art.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy126,ESTJ,"And I think we have a tendency
to not be clear about this,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy127,ESTJ,"to try to move our inner truths
to outer truths,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy128,ESTJ,"or to not be fair about it to each other,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy129,ESTJ,"and when people are telling us
their inner truths,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy130,ESTJ,"to try to make them defend them
by outer-truth standards."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy131,ESTJ,"So I'm talking here about outer truth,
about objective things."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy132,ESTJ,"And there was an objective reality
in my haunted house, right?"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy133,ESTJ,"Now that I've told you about the gas leak,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy134,ESTJ,"I doubt a single person here
would be like,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy135,ESTJ,"""I still think there was a ghost, too"" --"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy136,ESTJ,(Laughter)
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy137,ESTJ,"because as soon as we have
these scientific explanations,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy138,ESTJ,we know to give up the ghost.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy139,ESTJ,"We use these things as stopgaps
for things that we can't explain."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy140,ESTJ,We don't believe them because of evidence;
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy141,ESTJ,"we believe them because
of a lack of evidence."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy142,ESTJ,So there is a group in Los Angeles
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy143,ESTJ,"called the Independent
Investigations Group, or the IIG,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy144,ESTJ,and they do great work.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy145,ESTJ,"They'll give a $10,000 prize"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy146,ESTJ,"to anyone who can show,
under scientific conditions,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy147,ESTJ,that they have a paranormal ability.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy148,ESTJ,"No one's done it yet,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy149,ESTJ,"but they've had a couple people
who claim that they were clairaudients,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy150,ESTJ,"which means that they can hear voices
either from the great beyond"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy151,ESTJ,or they can read minds.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy152,ESTJ,"And they had one person
who was very sincere,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy153,ESTJ,who believed that he could read minds.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy154,ESTJ,"So they set up a test with him,
and this is the way it always works."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy155,ESTJ,"The group says, ""OK, we have a protocol,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy156,ESTJ,we have a way to scientifically test this.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy157,ESTJ,"Do you agree with it?"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy158,ESTJ,The person says yes. Then they test it.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy159,ESTJ,It's very important that both sides agree.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy160,ESTJ,"They did that, they tested him."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy161,ESTJ,"They said, ""OK, you know what?"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy162,ESTJ,"You weren't able to predict
what Lisa was thinking."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy163,ESTJ,It matched up about the same as chance.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy164,ESTJ,"Looks like you don't have the power."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy165,ESTJ,And that gave them the opportunity
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy166,ESTJ,"to compassionately sit down with him
and have a very difficult discussion,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy167,ESTJ,"which basically amounted to,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy168,ESTJ,"""Hey, we know you're sincere,
and what that means is,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy169,ESTJ,"you do hear something in your head."""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy170,ESTJ,"And that guy got to make
the very difficult decision,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy171,ESTJ,"but really the life-changing decision
about whether to go get help."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy172,ESTJ,"We're actually helping people
to make these connections"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy173,ESTJ,"that maybe before seemed like
otherworldly explanations,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy174,ESTJ,"help draw us into reality
and maybe change our lives for the better."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy175,ESTJ,"Now, on the other hand,
maybe one time it'll turn out to be true."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy176,ESTJ,"Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy177,ESTJ,"and holy shit, it will be the best thing!"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy178,ESTJ,"And every time I do
one of these investigations,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy179,ESTJ,"I still get so excited,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy180,ESTJ,"and I'm like 75 into them,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy181,ESTJ,"and still I swear on number 76,
I'm going to be like, ""This is the one!"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy182,ESTJ,(Laughter)
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy183,ESTJ,"Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic,
but I hope I never lose this hope,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy184,ESTJ,"and I invite you to take
this same attitude"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy185,ESTJ,"when people share
their outer beliefs with you."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy186,ESTJ,"When talking about testable claims,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy187,ESTJ,"respect them enough to ask
these good questions."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy188,ESTJ,"Challenge and see
how you can examine them together,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy189,ESTJ,"because there's this idea
that you can't respect a belief"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy190,ESTJ,"and still challenge it,
but that's not true."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy191,ESTJ,"When we jiggle the lock,
when we test the claim,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy192,ESTJ,"we're saying, OK, I respect you,
I'm listening to what you're saying,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy193,ESTJ,I'm going to test it out with you.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy194,ESTJ,"We've all had that experience
where you're telling someone something,"
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy195,ESTJ,"and they're like, ""Oh,
that's really interesting, yeah,"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy196,ESTJ,you know you're being had.
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy197,ESTJ,"But when someone says, ""Really? Huh."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy198,ESTJ,"Sounds a little sketchy to me,
but I'm listening,"""
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy199,ESTJ,"you at least know
you're being engaged and respected."
ESTJ_A scientific approach to the paranormal | Carrie Poppy200,ESTJ,"And that's the kind of attitude
we should have with these claims."

ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM0,ESTJc,"Translator: Queenie Lee
Reviewer: Ivana Korom"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM1,ESTJc,Let me ask you something.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM2,ESTJc,Have you ever been in a situation
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM3,ESTJc,"where you've asked yourself
the following question:"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM4,ESTJc,"is this person, is this person
flirting with me?"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM5,ESTJc,"Picture the scene:
you're at a friend's party."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM6,ESTJc,You sashay into the kitchen
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM7,ESTJc,"because we all know
that's where the fun is."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM8,ESTJc,And you see an attractive stranger
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM9,ESTJc,getting a drink refill from a box of wine.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM10,ESTJc,Your friend's a student.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM11,ESTJc,"And so you get a drink refill,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM12,ESTJc,"and you say something hilarious
to the attractive stranger."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM13,ESTJc,Attractive stranger laughs.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM14,ESTJc,Good for you.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM15,ESTJc,And then for the next few minutes
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM16,ESTJc,"there's some eye contact, more talking."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM17,ESTJc,But then after a few minutes
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM18,ESTJc,"you start thinking,
'Is this person flirting with me?'"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM19,ESTJc,"Sound familiar, anyone?"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM20,ESTJc,"See the person sitting next to you,
it's happened to them."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM21,ESTJc,"The person in front of you,
it's happened to them."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM22,ESTJc,You see this is a universal conundrum.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM23,ESTJc,But no more!
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM24,ESTJc,Because in the next ten minutes
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM25,ESTJc,"I'm going to tell you
the signs of flirting"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM26,ESTJc,"and never again will you wonder:
is this person flirting with me?"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM27,ESTJc,I'm Jean Smith.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM28,ESTJc,"I'm a social anthropologist
who studies flirting,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM29,ESTJc,"a flirtologist, if you will."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM30,ESTJc,"Now, as a flirtologist, I do research,
I write books, I give talks."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM31,ESTJc,"And I work with clients
both private and corporate,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM32,ESTJc,"all with the goal of helping people
to become better flirts."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM33,ESTJc,"So I can see some of you
sitting there, you're thinking,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM34,ESTJc,"'Really!? Is this necessary?
I mean teaching people how to flirt?'"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM35,ESTJc,Yes.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM36,ESTJc,(Laughter)
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM37,ESTJc,"Yes, it is."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM38,ESTJc,I've been doing this for over a decade.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM39,ESTJc,And if the question -
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM40,ESTJc,"is this person flirting with me -
was popular then,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM41,ESTJc,"it's now everyone-wants-
to-take-it-to-prom popular"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM42,ESTJc,because over the last decade
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM43,ESTJc,"the way that we flirt
has changed dramatically."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM44,ESTJc,"People are relying more and more
on digital ways of communicating."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM45,ESTJc,"But let's face it,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM46,ESTJc,"an emoji with its tongue sticking out,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM47,ESTJc,it's only going to get you so far.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM48,ESTJc,"At some point, you're going
to have to meet in person."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM49,ESTJc,"Unless of course, you're a Japanese male,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM50,ESTJc,"and in that case, you could go on to marry
your video game girlfriend: Rinko."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM51,ESTJc,"So as part of my quest
to help people become better flirts,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM52,ESTJc,I did research.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM53,ESTJc,"I went to the cities of London,
New York, Paris and Stockholm,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM54,ESTJc,"and I researched the flirting behaviour
of its inhabitants."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM55,ESTJc,"And I found there were six things
that they all had in common."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM56,ESTJc,"Six ways that they could signal
they were flirting"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM57,ESTJc,"and understood when someone
was flirting with them."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM58,ESTJc,And I teach this as
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM59,ESTJc,H.O.T.-A.P.E.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM60,ESTJc,(Laughter)
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM61,ESTJc,"It's the six signs - it's an acronym
for the six signs of flirting."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM62,ESTJc,"So what if I were to say to you:
'You must be a parking ticket"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM63,ESTJc,"because you've got ""fine""
written all over you.'"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM64,ESTJc,Would you laugh?
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM65,ESTJc,"Well, 'H' is for humour."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM66,ESTJc,"Raise your hand
if you thought my joke was funny."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM67,ESTJc,"Go ahead, don't be shy."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM68,ESTJc,"OK, everyone with their hands up,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM69,ESTJc,I would totally date you.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM70,ESTJc,(Laughter)
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM71,ESTJc,"Well, if my husband

ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM72,ESTJc,"But anyway, if you
didn't raise your hands,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM73,ESTJc,it's not a good match.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM74,ESTJc,It's just not going to work between us.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM75,ESTJc,"But it's me, not you."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM76,ESTJc,But this is a good thing
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM77,ESTJc,because HOTAPE-ing people -
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM78,ESTJc,it takes time.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM79,ESTJc,"Does anyone here
like reading a good novel,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM80,ESTJc,watching an interesting TED talk?
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM81,ESTJc,Does anyone here like test cricket?
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM82,ESTJc,"These things also take time,
especially test cricket, five days?"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM83,ESTJc,"And this is where people
often get it wrong"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM84,ESTJc,because they want to attract everybody.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM85,ESTJc,"But no, you just want
to attract those people"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM86,ESTJc,who match with you.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM87,ESTJc,"And that's why humour,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM88,ESTJc,"specifically a shared sense of humour,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM89,ESTJc,"is really important
for helping you to differentiate"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM90,ESTJc,"between your potential HOT-APEs
and squirrel monkeys."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM91,ESTJc,"I mean, yeah, they're cute."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM92,ESTJc,I'm sure they have a great personality.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM93,ESTJc,"But at the end of the day
it's a squirrel monkey."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM94,ESTJc,It's no HOT-APE.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM95,ESTJc,So 'O' is for open body language.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM96,ESTJc,Three things to remember.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM97,ESTJc,"Number one, don't do this."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM98,ESTJc,I know some of you are guilty of this.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM99,ESTJc,"I've heard it all before,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM100,ESTJc,"oh, but I'm cold, or, this is comfortable."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM101,ESTJc,"OK, whiny voice aside, in which instance"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM102,ESTJc,do you want to HOT-APE me more?
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM103,ESTJc,Like this?
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM104,ESTJc,"Or like this, right?"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM105,ESTJc,Not HOT-APE.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM106,ESTJc,HOT-APE.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM107,ESTJc,"Number two: make sure your shoulders
are facing the person."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM108,ESTJc,"So not HOT-APE,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM109,ESTJc,"not HOT-APE, still not HOT-APE."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM110,ESTJc,HOT-APE.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM111,ESTJc,Not HOT-APE.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM112,ESTJc,HOT-APE.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM113,ESTJc,"Now, the third,
this is the most important,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM114,ESTJc,and I'm only telling you guys.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM115,ESTJc,This is a really good one.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM116,ESTJc,"To see if someone's interested,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM117,ESTJc,"look at the direction
in which their feet are pointing."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM118,ESTJc,"So if their feet
are pointing at you, a good sign."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM119,ESTJc,"If they're kind of out to the side,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM120,ESTJc,"it means they're planning
their escape route."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM121,ESTJc,"The further away our limbs
are from our brain,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM122,ESTJc,the harder it is for us to control them.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM123,ESTJc,"So, Shakira, I know you say:
the hips don't lie,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM124,ESTJc,"but the flirtologist is here
to say the feet don't lie."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM125,ESTJc,'T' is for touch.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM126,ESTJc,"Like humour, touch also has a positive
physiological response on our body."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM127,ESTJc,"Now as a general rule, shoulder -
it's a safe place to touch."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM128,ESTJc,"But as you go down the arm
towards the hands,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM129,ESTJc,the touch gets more intimate.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM130,ESTJc,"That's why I recommend everyone
should kind of tap the hand"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM131,ESTJc,and say something like:
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM132,ESTJc,"'Oh, you're so funny',"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM133,ESTJc,people seem to love that stuff.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM134,ESTJc,"Oh, another place
that would be nice to touch"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM135,ESTJc,would be just here
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM136,ESTJc,"at the top of the back
between the shoulder blades,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM137,ESTJc,"perhaps if you're passing by,
you can give a light touch."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM138,ESTJc,"Now, of all of the flirting signs,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM139,ESTJc,"people seem to be wariest
about using touch."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM140,ESTJc,"As one of my clients said,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM141,ESTJc,"'Well, the other signs
you can get away with."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM142,ESTJc,"But when it comes to touch,
you're culpable.'"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM143,ESTJc,"But touch can get you
out of the friend zone,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM144,ESTJc,"and it can also show someone
that you're interested."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM145,ESTJc,"And as long as you remember,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM146,ESTJc,"I like test cricket,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM147,ESTJc,"it lasts five days,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM148,ESTJc,"I don't have time
to HOT-APE with everyone,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM149,ESTJc,"then if the person
doesn't respond positively,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM150,ESTJc,you can try someone else.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM151,ESTJc,'A' is for attention.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM152,ESTJc,This one might seem obvious.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM153,ESTJc,"The more attention someone is paying you,
the more they like you."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM154,ESTJc,"But the problem is
once you are in the interaction,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM155,ESTJc,it's really hard to be objective.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM156,ESTJc,"Which is why in anthropology,
we have a methodology,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM157,ESTJc,it's called participant observation.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM158,ESTJc,"And I think this could be a really
useful tool for you to use in flirting."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM159,ESTJc,"It means that you're participating,
you're in the interaction,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM160,ESTJc,"but you're not so in it
that you can't observe."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM161,ESTJc,"So if you were to, for example,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM162,ESTJc,"touch and say something
and see the other person blushed,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM163,ESTJc,it means that you're not so self-conscious
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM164,ESTJc,"that you can't observe the effect
that you're having on the other person."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM165,ESTJc,"And that my friends
is when the flirting gets really fun."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM166,ESTJc,'P' is for proximity.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM167,ESTJc,Now proximity was used in two ways.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM168,ESTJc,"The first, if you see someone
across the room"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM169,ESTJc,"and then all of a sudden
they're next to your side,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM170,ESTJc,this is not a coincidence.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM171,ESTJc,"It means they like what they see
and they must explore further."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM172,ESTJc,The other way proximity was used
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM173,ESTJc,"is when you're actually
in the interaction,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM174,ESTJc,they're standing closer than usual.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM175,ESTJc,"So if you're attracted, great."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM176,ESTJc,"If you're not, they're in your space."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM177,ESTJc,"So the last of the flirting signs
is the most important."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM178,ESTJc,Can anyone guess what it is?
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM179,ESTJc,Thank you.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM180,ESTJc,It's eye contact.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM181,ESTJc,This was the number one way
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM182,ESTJc,"that people could understand someone
who's flirting with them"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM183,ESTJc,"and the difference
between friendly and flirting."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM184,ESTJc,"So in flirting eye-contact
the gaze happened more often."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM185,ESTJc,"It was held for a longer amount of time,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM186,ESTJc,and it was more intense.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM187,ESTJc,So using these signs:
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM188,ESTJc,"humour, open body language, touch,
attention, proximity, eye contact,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM189,ESTJc,"you can recognize
when someone is flirting with you."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM190,ESTJc,"And as a general rule,
the more signs the better."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM191,ESTJc,"Now my favourite story of HOT-APE
being used in the field"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM192,ESTJc,was relayed to me by one of my clients.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM193,ESTJc,"She had shared HOT-APE
with all of her friends."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM194,ESTJc,"And one night, they went out
HOTAPE-ing guys."
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM195,ESTJc,"One of her friends was making
eye contact with a guy at the bar,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM196,ESTJc,and she went over and spoke with him.
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM197,ESTJc,"She came back a few minutes later,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM198,ESTJc,"bit dejected, my client said,"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM199,ESTJc,"'What happened? What happened?'
And she's like, 'Oh nothing.'"
ESTJc_The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM200,ESTJc,"'Well, did you HOT-APE him?'
She's like, 'Yeah, yeah.'"

INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?1,INTJc,"Why do humans play games?
Whether it's a video game or a board"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?2,INTJc,"game or a physical game, like soccer - or football.
I don't have to put the ball in"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?3,INTJc,"the net to survive, and, even if I did, why
would I invite a goalie and another team?"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?4,INTJc,"Games are weird. This lead Bernard Suits to
say in the 70's that a game is a voluntary"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?5,INTJc,"attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.
So, why do we play sports and games? How should"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?6,INTJc,"we feel about intellectualism vs. athleticism?
But, most importantly, why do Americans call"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?7,INTJc,"this game soccer while the English, and the
rest of the world, call it football?"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?8,INTJc,"It turns out that the word ""soccer"" doesn't
come from the United States of America. Instead,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?9,INTJc,"the blame for the word goes to the British
themselves, specifically Oxford, where, since"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?10,INTJc,"1875, it has been popular to add the suffix
""-er"" to the end of words. For example, calling"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?11,INTJc,"Radcliffe Camera the ""Radder,""
or these ""fivers"" and ""tenners."""
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?12,INTJc,"We have been playing games with balls and
our feet ever since ancient times, all over"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?13,INTJc,"the world. In fact, as recently as 200 years
ago, many of these games called themselves"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?14,INTJc,"""football."" A lack of standardization meant
that it was difficult to all come together"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?15,INTJc,"and agree on what you could and couldn't do
with the ball or your feet. But, luckily,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?16,INTJc,"in 1863 the Football Association was founded
in London, England. Association football is"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?17,INTJc,"what we most commonly mean nowadays when talking
about football, or soccer. But what's the connection"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?18,INTJc,"if the Oxford ""-er"" was added to Association
football, shouldn't we be calling the game"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?19,INTJc,"""Association-er?"" Well, let's take a closer

INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?21,INTJc,"But we're getting ahead of ourselves because
soccer, football, is just one type of game."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?22,INTJc,"Ultimately, what is a game? Well, one of my
favorite ways of defining ""game"" comes from"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?23,INTJc,"computer game designer Chris Crawford.
Let's begin with a book. This is a great book, it's"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?24,INTJc,"really fun, it's entertaining, but it's not a game.
TV shows and movies are also not games"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?25,INTJc,"because, fundamentally, they aren't interactive.
But as soon as something is both fun and"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?26,INTJc,"interactive, well, now we've got ourselves
a play-thing. There are two types of play-things,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?27,INTJc,"according to Crawford. If you can play with
the object and it's fun but there's no goal"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?28,INTJc,"or objective associated with it, it's a toy.
If, however, there is an objective, something"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?29,INTJc,"you're supposed to accomplish, well, now you're
talking about a challenge. But there are two"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?30,INTJc,"different types of challenges. If the challenge
involves no other people or other agents,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?31,INTJc,"it's just you, for instance, playing alone
with a Rubik's Cube, you've got yourself a"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?32,INTJc,"puzzle. If, however, there are other people
involved, well, now we've got ourselves a"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?33,INTJc,conflict.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?34,INTJc,"In a conflict, like a foot race, you aren't
allowed to interfere with the other participants."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?35,INTJc,"This is what Crawford calls a ""competition.""
If, however, you are allowed to interact with"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?36,INTJc,"and interfere with the other players and
they can do the same to you, well, in that"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?37,INTJc,"case, we are talking about a full-fledged game."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?38,INTJc,"So, a game is interactive, goal-oriented,
and involves other agents, for instance, other"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?39,INTJc,"people who can interfere with and influence
each other. Which means, technically speaking,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?40,INTJc,"that life is a game. I mean, real life.
My life, your life, easily fit many definitions"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?41,INTJc,"of ""game."" And, in life, there are games that
we tend to call ""sports."" Now, competency"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?42,INTJc,"at sports can divide humanity into two groups.
Jocks, who are good at sports, and nerds"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?43,INTJc,"who aren't. Jocks are literally named after
the Jock Strap, which keeps your genitals"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?44,INTJc,"supported while being athletic.
But jocks are cool, right? They're fit, attractive,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?45,INTJc,"they get invited to all the cool parties where,
in high school, they can do dangerous, cool"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?46,INTJc,"things like get drunk. And who are you if
you don't get drunk? Well, what's the word"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?47,INTJc,"""drunk"" backwards? You are a ""Knurd.""
But that's not the origin of the word ""nerd."""
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?48,INTJc,"There's much debate about where the word comes
from, but what we do know is that it emerged"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?49,INTJc,"as a slang term for ""lame"" or ""square"" in
Detroit in the early 1950's."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?50,INTJc,"The first known use of the word in print came
from Dr. Seuss himself and, fundamentally,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?51,INTJc,"it may come from the word ""nut,"" which meant
a crazy person, and was later altered to ""nert,"""
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?52,INTJc,"and, finally, ""nerd."" It exists today as a word
for un-athletic people largely because it"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?53,INTJc,"was popularized through its frequent use on
the US TV show ""Happy Days."""
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?54,INTJc,"Whether your spend your time on athletic pursuits
or intellectual pursuits, or both, games,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?55,INTJc,"in some form, are a part of your life.
So, why do we play games?"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?56,INTJc,"Humans, and many other"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?57,INTJc,"animals, play. And, perhaps, ""play"" originated
as a way of physically preparing our bodies"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?58,INTJc,"for life's real challenges later on. That
idea makes sense, but the evidence isn't convincing"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?59,INTJc,"because, in the wild, ""play"" can often lead
to a wasting of precious resources, injuries"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?60,INTJc,"and hardly comes close to simulating real
attacks and life-threatening situations."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?61,INTJc,"The New York Times wrote a great article about
this conundrum, pointing out that physically"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?62,INTJc,"preparing the body may be less of a priority
for ""play."" Instead, the point of ""play"" might"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?63,INTJc,"be preparing the brain. Play is good for the
brain, especially during formative, juvenile"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?64,INTJc,"years, when most of us have an instinctive urge
to goof around, play and pretend anyway."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?65,INTJc,"Young rats confined to cages with adult rats,
who refused to play with them, grew up with"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?66,INTJc,"smaller, less developed brains. This has led
to the hypothesis that games play a role in"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?67,INTJc,"the development of certain brain structures,
especially the cerebellum when we are young."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?68,INTJc,"But, to be clear, the evidence does not show
that play is vital for the development of"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?69,INTJc,"these regions. Other methods, like exercises
or teaching, may have a similar effect."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?70,INTJc,"They might not be as fun, but this is known
as equifinality. So there's debate as to just"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?71,INTJc,"how vital play and games really are.
Well, let's take a look at the rewards that games"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?72,INTJc,give us.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?73,INTJc,"In the first half of the 20th century, Abraham
Maslow constructed a hierarchy of human needs."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?74,INTJc,"The concept is popular in developmental psychology
as a way of thinking about human growth and"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?75,INTJc,"what motivates us to do things or to not
do things. In general, until the needs of"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?76,INTJc,"a lower tier are fulfilled, an individual
can't move on to fulfilling higher ones. For"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?77,INTJc,"instance, achieving confidence, or satisfying
the desire to learn and explore, aren't important"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?78,INTJc,"to a person in fear for their life and safety.
Play might be motivated by higher needs. Animals"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?79,INTJc,"play, but as we've seen in nature, not the
ones who are stressed or starving."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?80,INTJc,"The thing is, lower needs tend to be pretty
clear cut. If I'm hungry and I eat what I"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?81,INTJc,"need, I'm done. It's not that complicated.
But, as creatures and brains and cultures"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?82,INTJc,"become more complicated, so do their needs
and the behaviors required to fulfill them."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?83,INTJc,"This brings us back to the fact that life
itself fits Chris Crawford's definition of"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?84,INTJc,"a game. Arguably, life is the largest and
most complicated game on Earth. But playing"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?85,INTJc,"your life usually isn't as easy as simply
remembering to eat and drink and breath."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?86,INTJc,"In life, knowing what the correct next move
is isn't always easy. Feedback is rarely immediate."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?87,INTJc,"I don't know if the choices I made were the
best, most perfect choices for me until way"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?88,INTJc,"after I've made them, if even then.
Is this person, or city, or career right for me?"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?89,INTJc,"In life, the rules are complicated, the goals
are indeterminate and the methods for achieving"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?90,INTJc,"them are often unknown or different for every
single person. Plus, the rewards themselves"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?91,INTJc,are often slow to come or non-existent.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?92,INTJc,"So, in the face of all of that, it's no surprise
that we invented games within the larger game"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?93,INTJc,"of life itself that ensure fast, easy-to-achieve
and understandable rewards."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?94,INTJc,"Animals play too, but the complexity of rules
humans follow in their games, in many ways"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?95,INTJc,"reflect the complexity of the needs we find
ourselves able to pursue."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?96,INTJc,"In life, I don't always know the right choice.
I don't know the right job to apply for."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?97,INTJc,How to explain something to a child. How to best help my friends or when to call my mom.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?98,INTJc,"But in Bomberman, I know exactly what every power-up
does, every time, all the time."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?99,INTJc,"In poker, a royal flush beats two-of-a-kind,
no question about it. Couldn't be more clear."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?100,INTJc,"But in my life, is an acquaintance or colleague
really on my side? Well, in team sports there's"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?101,INTJc,"no unknown, everyone is color-coded."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?102,INTJc,"Games and sports are a phenomenal way to feel
the rewards we need, without all of the unknowns"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?103,INTJc,"of life. Even watching games and sports, merely
being a spectator, can fulfill some of Maslow's"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?104,INTJc,"needs. I can feel a sense of belonging by
supporting a team, and by supporting a team,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?105,INTJc,their successes can kind of become my successes.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?106,INTJc,"What a great way to get respect without doing
a lot of work. It's known as BIRG-ing: Basking"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?107,INTJc,"In Reflected Glory. The opposite is CORF-ing:
Cutting Off Reflected Failure. If a team is"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?108,INTJc,"disgraced, I can easily say I was not really
ever that big of a fan anyway."
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?109,INTJc,"BIRG-ing and CORF-ing extend beyond sports.
We BIRG and CORF workplace projects, school"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?110,INTJc,"projects, celebrities, election candidates.
The point is, life is a game, but winning"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?111,INTJc,"and losing are nebulous. So, we invented simpler
games to provide psychological rewards faster"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?112,INTJc,"and more efficiently than life itself does.
Which is why, at their darkest, games can"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?113,INTJc,lead to procrastination or addiction.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?114,INTJc,"But don't fear. You have the potential to
become a jock at the game of life, it's just"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?115,INTJc,"not always that fun. And whenever you play
man-made games, rest assured that it's simply"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?116,INTJc,"because you, and all of us, are able to pursue
the fulfillment of needs higher than any other"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?117,INTJc,creature on Earth.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?118,INTJc,"And as always,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?119,INTJc,thanks for watching.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?120,INTJc,"Oh, and if you want some soccer science, why
not check out my video with Copa90, "

with so much spin that it not only curves,"
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?123,INTJc,but boomerangs back to the kicker.
INTJc_Why Do We Play Games?124,INTJc,"Okay, bye."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial0,INTJc,"Okay, I want to record one last video today"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial1,INTJc,it occurred to me while I was making that video about looking at how objects might communicate with each other. That there's a kind of
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial2,INTJc,a key principle going on in how variables are passed in as arguments to other functions
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial3,INTJc,that has been missed throughout all of these videos. So I don't think I'm going to have an example for this
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial4,INTJc,I'm just going to kind of dia... Talk you through this and diagram it and
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial5,INTJc,we'll see what's missing and what needs to be added and what's confusing but
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial6,INTJc,So I'm going to make up kind of a silly function almost a function that has no point
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial7,INTJc,I'm going to call it
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial8,INTJc,change
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial9,INTJc,and
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial10,INTJc,it's going to receive a
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial11,INTJc,single number as an argument and
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial12,INTJc,"Inside this function, I'm going to say that value equals value"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial13,INTJc,times two.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial14,INTJc,"okay, so this function receives a number and and"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial15,INTJc,multiplies that number by two and stores it back in itself.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial16,INTJc,So if I say int x. Can you see that? No you can't. Let me write it a little lower. int x equals
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial17,INTJc,50 and then I say change
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial18,INTJc,x and
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial19,INTJc,Then I say print
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial20,INTJc,Line X
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial21,INTJc,What is the result of this print line going to be so let's think about it x has the value 50?
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial22,INTJc,change x means x goes into val
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial23,INTJc,So val now has the value 50 then val equals itself times 2 so val
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial24,INTJc,"Now has the value of 100, but when I print x am I going to see 100 or 50?"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial25,INTJc,Think about that you know as the designer of the programming language. It's up to you to decide. What it should be.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial26,INTJc,The Java Programming language on which processing is built on top of
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial27,INTJc,What we're going to see is the number 50. Why is that? This is known as pass by copy.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial28,INTJc,"When you pass a primitive value a number,"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial29,INTJc,"integer, float"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial30,INTJc,ETC into a
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial31,INTJc,function you pass a copy of that value meaning in the computer's memory x
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial32,INTJc,is
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial33,INTJc,Referencing a place in the computer's memory with the value 50 then val is
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial34,INTJc,Referencing another place in the computer's memory with what the value 50 gets copied in there then over here
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial35,INTJc,"val gets multiplied by 2. Val now equals 100, but x which is pointing to 50 is unaffected"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial36,INTJc,Pass by copy. The reason why I have bringing this up and to realize why this is so import..
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial37,INTJc,this is so important. Is if you pass an object into a function. It does not work this way. It works with something called pass
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial38,INTJc,by reference.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial39,INTJc,So let's pretend
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial40,INTJc,There's a made-up particle object and that particle object just has an x and a y. So I'm going to say a Particle
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial41,INTJc,p equals new Particle... you know 50 comma 100. And
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial42,INTJc,"then I'm going to say, change"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial43,INTJc,p and there's a function called
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial44,INTJc,void change
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial45,INTJc,which receives a Particle object call it a...
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial46,INTJc,"blah. It just needs to be a different variable name, it's terrible. I"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial47,INTJc,"hate that I just made up a variable name blah. Let's think of something particle... I'm going to call it some p, aP. A"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial48,INTJc,particle. aP. Now if I say aP dot x
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial49,INTJc,equals
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial50,INTJc,300.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial51,INTJc,"What's happening? Okay, so..."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial52,INTJc,This is my equivalent of int x equals 50 change x now I'm saying particle P equals new Particle change p.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial53,INTJc,"This change function, I should've... instead of multiplying it by 2"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial54,INTJc,I'm just setting it to the value 300 and remember x
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial55,INTJc,was 50 and then we made a new variable val was 100. So here
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial56,INTJc,I have a particle p and it is pointed to somewhere in the computer's memory.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial57,INTJc,Where both 50 and 100 is stored.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial58,INTJc,"Now here. I make a new particle. aP. Some p at tempP, whatever."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial59,INTJc,I do not make a new object when you pass an object into a function
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial60,INTJc,"You're passing the reference. The at... the location of the the data in memory, not a copy that data."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial61,INTJc,"So aP is actually pointing over here, and if I change..."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial62,INTJc,"the aspects, parameters, data of that object like x becomes 300. I'm changing the original"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial63,INTJc,"variable as well. Pass by reference, so in Java when you pass a"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial64,INTJc,"primitive value into a function, as an argument you make a copy of it and the original variable is unaffected. When you pass an object"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial65,INTJc,"into a function, the original..."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial66,INTJc,you're passing just a reference and if you change that object in the function it is also changed as well.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial67,INTJc,Let me... let me show you an actual scenario where this matters. So if we come back to this...
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial68,INTJc,right. What if my... this is... this example where I'm just changing the background color so I'm going to...
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial69,INTJc,Save this as a version 2 and I'm just going to make a function called p1
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial70,INTJc,overlaps p2 and it's not going to return true or false anymore.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial71,INTJc,"Ok and in that function, it's just"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial72,INTJc,void. I can I'm going to do something if they overlap.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial73,INTJc,And what am I going to do? I'm going to give?
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial74,INTJc,the
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial75,INTJc,the particle a color and
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial76,INTJc,that color is going to be...
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial77,INTJc,Black to start. And I'm going to say fill that color
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial78,INTJc,And when it overlaps I'm going to say other dot color equals red.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial79,INTJc,otherwise other dot color equals...
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial80,INTJc,Black. So I know I'm doing this kind of quickly you may or may not be following along
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial81,INTJc,But let me show you why this is so important.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial82,INTJc,Notice when they overlap this particle changes its color. I'm passing
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial83,INTJc,p2 into the function. A copy is not made.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial84,INTJc,"I'm passing the... a reference to the actual object and p2, the reference to that object, goes into other. And now I'm changing"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial85,INTJc,values of other. If I'm changing values of other that means I'm actually
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial86,INTJc,changing values of p2 and p2 is now going to be red.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial87,INTJc,Incidentally I could say
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial88,INTJc,"also, this objects color is green and let me give these each a little alpha..."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial89,INTJc,"So if we look at this, you can see now..."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial90,INTJc,"They're both black... one turns green, one turns red, one turns green, one turns red."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial91,INTJc,The other thing to note about this is it seemed like in the original
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial92,INTJc,version of this program p1 overlaps p2 was equivalent to p2 overlaps p1.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial93,INTJc,But now if I were to change that
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial94,INTJc,Since I'm giving them the p2 is now turning green and the other one is turning red.
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial95,INTJc,So there's a lot of goofiness going on here in this sort of like forest and fake example...
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial96,INTJc,But I think this is important to realize that if you're passing
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial97,INTJc,"This object into a function you can actually change that object in the function itself, okay..."
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial98,INTJc,So I don't know if this makes things better or worse. I think I just said that in the last video...
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial99,INTJc,But I'm kind of like today
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial100,INTJc,"I just have this day where I'm wrapping up all these videos are trying to make extra little pieces of content, so"
INTJc_8.6: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference - Processing Tutorial101,INTJc,This one's only like 7 minutes long which isn't so bad. ok see you later.
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing0,ENTJ,in the last few videos I've been talking

ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing24,ENTJ,have to be the most popular music in the
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing25,ENTJ,world doesn't have to be top 40 or
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing26,ENTJ,anything like that it's simply beautiful
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing27,ENTJ,music that you aspire towards being able

ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing29,ENTJ,similar manner the idea behind this
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing30,ENTJ,technique is that you look at these
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing31,ENTJ,beautiful reference tracks and then you

ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing33,ENTJ,you're working on
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing34,ENTJ,to see what your songs are either
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing35,ENTJ,lacking or maybe if there's too many
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing36,ENTJ,elements or too few or just general
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing37,ENTJ,tonal imbalances in your mix in just a
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing38,ENTJ,minute I'll show a few ways that you can
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing39,ENTJ,incorporate using a reference track
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing40,ENTJ,inside your door whilst you're mixing to
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing41,ENTJ,help you improve but first of all why
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing42,ENTJ,would you actually want to do this what
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing43,ENTJ,benefit is there to using a reference
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing44,ENTJ,track and comparing it against your own
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing45,ENTJ,song to a lot of people this will
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing46,ENTJ,probably seem really obvious but you
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing47,ENTJ,want to listen to the reference track in
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing48,ENTJ,your studio so that you can actually get
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing49,ENTJ,an understanding of what a good mix
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing50,ENTJ,sounds like in your mixing environment
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing51,ENTJ,because a lot of the time when we hear
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing52,ENTJ,good mixes we're not necessarily in our
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing53,ENTJ,studio we might be in the car might be
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing54,ENTJ,in the gym who knows where you might be
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing55,ENTJ,listening on headphones you need to know
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing56,ENTJ,what that mix actually sounds like if
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing57,ENTJ,you were in your studio or home studio
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing58,ENTJ,or a bedroom and mixing it yourself the
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing59,ENTJ,second reason is something that I talked
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing60,ENTJ,about in my hearing protection video I
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing61,ENTJ,talked about your ears becoming really
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing62,ENTJ,used to the music you're listening to so
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing63,ENTJ,if you're listening to something with a
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing64,ENTJ,huge amount of low mids and maybe
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing65,ENTJ,lacking in the high-end you become very
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing66,ENTJ,used to it over the course of a few
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing67,ENTJ,hours and that starts sounding like
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing68,ENTJ,normal to you so your ears have kind of
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing69,ENTJ,adjusted to the imbalances in your mix
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing70,ENTJ,if you then listen to a professionally
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing71,ENTJ,finished mix or one of these reference
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing72,ENTJ,tracks that you really like it sort of
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing73,ENTJ,resets what the balance should sound
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing74,ENTJ,like and you'll immediately be able to
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing75,ENTJ,hear that the track you've been
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing76,ENTJ,listening to for hours just has way too
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing77,ENTJ,much low or maybe it doesn't have enough
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing78,ENTJ,bass or there's too much high end it
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing79,ENTJ,will start making all of these problems
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing80,ENTJ,really apparent to you and the third
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing81,ENTJ,reason is just that it saves you time if
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing82,ENTJ,you have something to work towards not
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing83,ENTJ,copy but if you have something to work
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing84,ENTJ,towards it's gonna just save you time
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing85,ENTJ,you know kind of what you're aiming
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing86,ENTJ,towards and you can make decisions a lot
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing87,ENTJ,easier to try and fit your track into
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing88,ENTJ,that sort of mold with that being said
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing89,ENTJ,you're not trying to copy the track it
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing90,ENTJ,doesn't matter if your kick drum doesn't
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing91,ENTJ,sound the same or your bass doesn't
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing92,ENTJ,sound the same or you're using a
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing93,ENTJ,different snare that's all completely
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing94,ENTJ,fine it's sort of like the general
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing95,ENTJ,picture the overall tonal balance the
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing96,ENTJ,overall width the depth the dimension
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing97,ENTJ,these are the sorts of things we're
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing98,ENTJ,listening for now that we know what a
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing99,ENTJ,reference track is and some reasons why
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing100,ENTJ,we might want to use them let's talk
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing101,ENTJ,about how to actually use them so first
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing102,ENTJ,things first you have to find mixes that
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing103,ENTJ,you really love it could even be songs
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing104,ENTJ,that you've mixed in the past that you
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing105,ENTJ,really like or they could be from
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing106,ENTJ,up-and-coming artists and mixing
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing107,ENTJ,engineers it's just anything that really
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing108,ENTJ,inspires you and the mixing that you
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing109,ENTJ,really enjoy so if you download the song
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing110,ENTJ,and you pull it into your DAW you can
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing111,ENTJ,just put it on its own track and compare
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing112,ENTJ,it to your song this is the part where
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing113,ENTJ,this technique starts falling down
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing114,ENTJ,because a lot of people will compare but
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing115,ENTJ,the finished track will be a lot louder
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing116,ENTJ,and it's mastered it can be really
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing117,ENTJ,demotivating and sort of crushing to
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing118,ENTJ,compare your rough mix to a completely
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing119,ENTJ,finished and professional product so you
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing120,ENTJ,need to start by level matching by
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing121,ENTJ,taking the mastered version and just
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing122,ENTJ,taking the volume down until it matches
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing123,ENTJ,the rough volume of your track at that
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing124,ENTJ,point you just need to sort of figure
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing125,ENTJ,out where the verses where the chorus is
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing126,ENTJ,and you just a B so you just solo that
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing127,ENTJ,track on its own listen to it for a few
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing128,ENTJ,seconds maybe five ten seconds get used
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing129,ENTJ,to the overall balance mute it and then
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing130,ENTJ,unmute your song and take a listen to it
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing131,ENTJ,and just try to listen
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing132,ENTJ,for overall differences now you could do
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing133,ENTJ,this in the session you're working in or
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing134,ENTJ,you could print out your song pull it
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing135,ENTJ,into a new session and just compare them
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing136,ENTJ,above and below each other and don't
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing137,ENTJ,worry too much about things like exact
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing138,ENTJ,details like it doesn't matter if your
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing139,ENTJ,kick sounds different it doesn't matter
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing140,ENTJ,if the vocal style is all different
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing141,ENTJ,you're just listening for the overall
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing142,ENTJ,balance it's highly likely that if you
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing143,ENTJ,just use your ears you'll be able to
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing144,ENTJ,hear pretty big differences and start
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing145,ENTJ,honing in on problems in your own mix
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing146,ENTJ,and making big improvements but if
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing147,ENTJ,you're not quite trusting your ears
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing148,ENTJ,there's a few tools that you can use to
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing149,ENTJ,help you out and then there's two I'm
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing150,ENTJ,going to talk about here the first one
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing151,ENTJ,is the tonal balance tool from iZotope
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing152,ENTJ,which is pretty handy and this sort of
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing153,ENTJ,breaks down the frequency spectrum into
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing154,ENTJ,bands either roughly or fine and it sort
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing155,ENTJ,of shows you the distribution of
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing156,ENTJ,frequencies much like a spectrum
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing157,ENTJ,analyzer and it can show you whether you
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing158,ENTJ,have a bit too much bass a bit too much
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing159,ENTJ,high end compared to many commercial
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing160,ENTJ,releases or you can listen to the
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing161,ENTJ,reference track through that and see
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing162,ENTJ,sort of what their curve looks like and
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing163,ENTJ,then compare it to the curve or spectrum
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing164,ENTJ,of your own song that's a paid-for
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing165,ENTJ,plugin but there is a free alternative
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing166,ENTJ,called span and if you set it up right
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing167,ENTJ,and I'll leave all the settings in the
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing168,ENTJ,description box down below you can run
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing169,ENTJ,someone else's song through it in real
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing170,ENTJ,time and it sort of generates a profile
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing171,ENTJ,that you can look at and then you can
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing172,ENTJ,turn on your song and compare it and you
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing173,ENTJ,can see whether there's any Peaks or
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing174,ENTJ,troughs that don't really add up to see
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing175,ENTJ,whether there's anything missing as
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing176,ENTJ,usual it's always best to trust your
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing177,ENTJ,ears but sometimes having these extra
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing178,ENTJ,visual tools can help you when mixing
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing179,ENTJ,but remember that it really does come
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing180,ENTJ,down to your ears at the end of the day
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing181,ENTJ,so just because a tool says that you're
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing182,ENTJ,in the right tonal balance it doesn't
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing183,ENTJ,necessarily mean it's gonna be right for
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing184,ENTJ,your song as I said at the start this
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing185,ENTJ,really is a simple technique but it is
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing186,ENTJ,commonly overlooked because it's quite
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing187,ENTJ,difficult to actually pull in finished
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing188,ENTJ,mastered tracks into your session and
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing189,ENTJ,compare them to your song when I pull
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing190,ENTJ,these sorts of tracks into the sessions
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing191,ENTJ,I'm working on it really can be
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing192,ENTJ,difficult to face that your mix does
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing193,ENTJ,need a lot of work and often you know
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing194,ENTJ,when I listen to there is it just sounds
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing195,ENTJ,so good by comparison but it is giving
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing196,ENTJ,you something to work towards and
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing197,ENTJ,to try not be too sort of demotivated
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing198,ENTJ,buyer and just remember that ultimately
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing199,ENTJ,this is trying to raise the quality of
ENTJ_Why You Need To Use Reference Tracks When Mixing200,ENTJ,your tracks and it's not something to

ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!72,ENFJc,enjoys then we're focusing on he so this
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!73,ENFJc,will refer back so we need to go back in
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!74,ENFJc,the paragraph if we fight if we're
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!75,ENFJc,trying to understand what this means or
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!76,ENFJc,what this refers to then we need to go a
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!77,ENFJc,sentence back and we need to identify

ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!152,ENFJc,to find the right answer pause the video
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!153,ENFJc,we'll come back in a second right did
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!154,ENFJc,you get it
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!155,ENFJc,there there what's referring back to
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!156,ENFJc,which subject is it referring back to
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!157,ENFJc,okay let's have a look let's have a look
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!158,ENFJc,at this so the word they're highlighted
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!159,ENFJc,in paragraph three refers to researchers
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!160,ENFJc,participants artists or non artists

ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!163,ENFJc,considered themselves artists so that
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!164,ENFJc,their results could be compared to non
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!165,ENFJc,artists okay so we got a few options
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!166,ENFJc,here it could be participants it could
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!167,ENFJc,be artists so the results could be
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!168,ENFJc,compared to non artists but this one
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!169,ENFJc,comes after so we're not going to do non
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!170,ENFJc,artists so we'll eliminate that one that
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!171,ENFJc,comes after the reference word we want
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!172,ENFJc,to find the subject before the reference
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!173,ENFJc,worth so participants results could be
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!174,ENFJc,compared or artist results could be
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!175,ENFJc,compared what did you get because really
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!176,ENFJc,there are two options here okay the
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!177,ENFJc,answer is in fact participants that is
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!178,ENFJc,the subject for which that pronoun there
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!179,ENFJc,refers back to participants not artists
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!180,ENFJc,because there's also a meaning thing
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!181,ENFJc,going on there let's let's have a look
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!182,ENFJc,at the meaning aspect of it as well so
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!183,ENFJc,we've got participants in the study
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!184,ENFJc,considered themselves artists so sorry
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!185,ENFJc,it was noted and tracked which
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!186,ENFJc,participants in the study considered
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!187,ENFJc,themselves artists so that they're the
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!188,ENFJc,participants results could be compared
ENFJc_TOEFL Reading Skill 4: Reference with Jay!189,ENFJc,to non artists

are and the kinds of details you need"

they agree to write you need to follow"
ISFJc_Reference letter for graduate school: Who do you ask?40,ISFJc,"up immediately with a thank you and
clear directions. The best way to give"
ISFJc_Reference letter for graduate school: Who do you ask?41,ISFJc,"those directions is in a table like this
one. This is a tidy list with dates and"
ISFJc_Reference letter for graduate school: Who do you ask?42,ISFJc,"how to complete the letters. This also
indicates what programs you're applying"
ISFJc_Reference letter for graduate school: Who do you ask?43,ISFJc,"to and that's very important for letter
writers so they can tailor their letters"
ISFJc_Reference letter for graduate school: Who do you ask?44,ISFJc,"to your applications. In your follow-up
email with this kind of table I suggest"
ISFJc_Reference letter for graduate school: Who do you ask?45,ISFJc,"one more thing. Tell them that you will
check in four working days before each"

then do it. It's okay to remind your"

ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6951,ESTJc,[Music]
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6952,ESTJc,it would take a while and I think they
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6953,ESTJc,want to close as soon as possible and
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6954,ESTJc,try to do it obviously before the
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6955,ESTJc,increase closing costs take into effect
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6956,ESTJc,so I think the bridge alone would just
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6957,ESTJc,be too complicated and I think this is
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6958,ESTJc,the path of least resistance to actually
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6959,ESTJc,get this deal done so why don't you talk
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6960,ESTJc,to the investors and come back to us as
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6961,ESTJc,soon as you can and then we'll go back
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6962,ESTJc,to them at at nine million and take your
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6963,ESTJc,leave it and you have until the end of
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6964,ESTJc,the week or we're moving on
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6965,ESTJc,[Music]
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6966,ESTJc,[Applause]
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6967,ESTJc,[Music]
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6968,ESTJc,[Music]
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6969,ESTJc,how are you I get do anything
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6970,ESTJc,three-year-old
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6971,ESTJc,oh there's a woman for her daughter and
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6972,ESTJc,then as she turns around she told her
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6973,ESTJc,friend she was like I don't have a
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6974,ESTJc,daughter that was for me and then you
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6975,ESTJc,know it's at what point do we adjust to
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6976,ESTJc,different price brackets right I'm still
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6977,ESTJc,hung up on this idea of showing up I
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6978,ESTJc,know this vlog probably seems a little
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6979,ESTJc,bit weird but I've been in like a super
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6980,ESTJc,weird mood today just if I'm being
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6981,ESTJc,honest like part of me thinks that I'm
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6982,ESTJc,by myself a lot just because of the way
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6983,ESTJc,that I think and then I'm a loner in
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6984,ESTJc,this my my my desire to do more every
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6985,ESTJc,single day and then sometimes I wish
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6986,ESTJc,like I feel comfortable just kicking my
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6987,ESTJc,shoes off take it off my tie I'm like
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6988,ESTJc,running onto the beach but that's just
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6989,ESTJc,it's not the person that I am and and I
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6990,ESTJc,am okay with it
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6991,ESTJc,but like at least I know that no matter
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6992,ESTJc,what happens for the rest of my life
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6993,ESTJc,that I will have been there in the
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6994,ESTJc,moment I will have shown up I will have
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6995,ESTJc,been there I would have been on time a
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6996,ESTJc,little been there early and that's where
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6997,ESTJc,all of my opportunity will have come
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6998,ESTJc,from it's like right now I'm in between
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #6999,ESTJc,appointments and gigs in Southern
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69100,ESTJc,California I'm just pissed off about
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69101,ESTJc,this idea of showing up and have so many
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69102,ESTJc,people just don't show up they don't
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69103,ESTJc,show up on time being on time is another
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69104,ESTJc,one of the things that you can do that's
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69105,ESTJc,so easy
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69106,ESTJc,it doesn't require any Talent being on
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69107,ESTJc,time is the number two thing that makes
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69108,ESTJc,me successful when I really really
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69109,ESTJc,really think about it like the people on
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69110,ESTJc,my team who get the most business are
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69111,ESTJc,the ones who show up who I see in the
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69112,ESTJc,office who are there early and who leave
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69113,ESTJc,licked now listen there are other people
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69114,ESTJc,who are incredibly talented who get
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69115,ESTJc,business on their own who can do things
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69116,ESTJc,on their own
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69117,ESTJc,those people can do whatever they want
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69118,ESTJc,right maybe they don't need to practice
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69119,ESTJc,maybe they're not LeBron but if you
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69120,ESTJc,don't have that talent and you want to
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69121,ESTJc,still be successful then you show up
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69122,ESTJc,why the fuck are there so many stairs in
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69123,ESTJc,new way
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69124,ESTJc,I've decided not coming back
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69125,ESTJc,Newport is pretty awesome New York
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69126,ESTJc,you've been great I love you it's my
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69127,ESTJc,wife and daughter I'm sure you can
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69128,ESTJc,figure it out
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69129,ESTJc,this place is super neato
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69130,ESTJc,it won't have come from that one person
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69131,ESTJc,who called me it won't have come from
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69132,ESTJc,the fact that I had an amazing jump shot
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69133,ESTJc,right it will come from the fact that I
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69134,ESTJc,showed up time and time and time and
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69135,ESTJc,time and time again you know there's
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69136,ESTJc,that quote that says that a river
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69137,ESTJc,doesn't cut through Rock because of its
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69138,ESTJc,power and cuts through Rock because of
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69139,ESTJc,its persistence and if you say anything
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69140,ESTJc,about me you know that I am persistent
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69141,ESTJc,and then I'm consistent and I'm there
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69142,ESTJc,every single day in and out no matter
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69143,ESTJc,what because it's the easiest part of
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69144,ESTJc,the job as meeting is part of life I was
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69145,ESTJc,just showing up and then being there and
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69146,ESTJc,it doesn't take any talent that's what
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69147,ESTJc,we've been talking about and my mind is
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69148,ESTJc,so much when people say oh well I I did
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69149,ESTJc,what I was told to do what was there
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69150,ESTJc,kind of on time because I was told to I
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69151,ESTJc,think that's what you're supposed to do
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69152,ESTJc,like that's your job your job is to do
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69153,ESTJc,what you're told to do I think the most
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69154,ESTJc,successful people that I know are
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69155,ESTJc,defined by the things that they do when
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69156,ESTJc,they're not told to do
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69157,ESTJc,they're defined by the things that they
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69158,ESTJc,do when no one ever even anticipated
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69159,ESTJc,that they would do them even as little
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69160,ESTJc,as waking up with going to the gym even
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69161,ESTJc,as little as staying up an extra half an
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69162,ESTJc,hour to get a little bit more work done
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69163,ESTJc,or to reply to those emails that they
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69164,ESTJc,were just too busy to do because life
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69165,ESTJc,got in the way like that little bit of
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69166,ESTJc,communication that little bit of touch
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69167,ESTJc,that warm touch on people goes a long
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69168,ESTJc,way
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69169,ESTJc,it's a significant amount of my business
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69170,ESTJc,no one hires me because a million-dollar
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69171,ESTJc,listing or going into this because that
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69172,ESTJc,no they hire me because they know I'm
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69173,ESTJc,gonna be there all the time and I'm
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69174,ESTJc,gonna be there no matter what daytime
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69175,ESTJc,nighttime and that is my talent so I
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69176,ESTJc,guess at the end of the day I came today
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69177,ESTJc,to Newport did this thing and I don't
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69178,ESTJc,know what's gonna happen I don't know
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69179,ESTJc,what's gonna come of it but it was an
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69180,ESTJc,opportunity I took it showed up and
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69181,ESTJc,we'll see what comes a bit down the line
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69182,ESTJc,maybe something will happen tomorrow
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69183,ESTJc,that happens to me it's a good thing
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69184,ESTJc,that happened because I came all the way
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69185,ESTJc,out here today maybe something happens
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69186,ESTJc,in five years maybe something happens in
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69187,ESTJc,ten years I don't know that's the way my
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69188,ESTJc,whole life is played out this far and I
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69189,ESTJc,gotta go
ESTJc_Hard Work vs Talent (Motivational) | Ryan Serhant Vlog #69190,ESTJc,if I'm late to my flight then I can't

INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners0,INTJc,"Hey friends, Kris Krohn here. And today"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners1,INTJc,we're talking about real estate for
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners2,INTJc,beginners. Real estate has a language to
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners3,INTJc,it. And if you understand some of the
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners4,INTJc,most important basic words and
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners5,INTJc,"principles, it can help you understand"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners6,INTJc,how to make a lot of money.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners7,INTJc,"So, you want to make a lot of money in"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners8,INTJc,real estate and you got to learn some of
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners9,INTJc,"the basic language. So, what I'm going to do"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners10,INTJc,today is I'm going to take this daunting
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners11,INTJc,vocabulary. And I'm going to help you
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners12,INTJc,understand some of the basics of it that
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners13,INTJc,will help you really get into the
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners14,INTJc,"whole game of real estate. So, what I've"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners15,INTJc,got is I've got some different words on
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners16,INTJc,the screen and what I'm going to do here is
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners17,INTJc,I'm going to map out what they are and what
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners18,INTJc,they mean. And I think that'll be really
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners19,INTJc,"helpful for you. So, first of all let's"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners20,INTJc,start with the most basic word up here.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners21,INTJc,"It's a home. Now, I want to be really"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners22,INTJc,clear that in real estate we've got
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners23,INTJc,different names for this. When we're
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners24,INTJc,"buying a piece of real estate, you have a"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners25,INTJc,lot of different types. One of them is
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners26,INTJc,called a single-family home. S-F-H. And
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners27,INTJc,"you'll see that abbreviation, if you look"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners28,INTJc,in the ads. Single family home just
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners29,INTJc,basically means this is a regular home
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners30,INTJc,"that one person is meant to rent. Now, all"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners31,INTJc,of a sudden if it is a home that is
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners32,INTJc,"split and has two doors, they have a"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners33,INTJc,different name for it. It's called a
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners34,INTJc,"duplex, okay? And then of course if you"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners35,INTJc,have one home with the single door but
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners36,INTJc,it's connected to a whole bunch of other
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners37,INTJc,"homes just like it, it's probably called"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners38,INTJc,"a condo or a townhouse. So, for me, I"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners39,INTJc,specialize often in this whole game of
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners40,INTJc,"single-family real estate. So, S-F-H."
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners41,INTJc,"Single family homes, right? So, that's what"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners42,INTJc,we mean by home. Next I want to talk
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners43,INTJc,about the word equity and I want to talk
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners44,INTJc,"about the word mortgage. Okay, if I want"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners45,INTJc,to buy a home and let's say this home is
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners46,INTJc,"$150,000."
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners47,INTJc,U.S. Then most people don't have a
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners48,INTJc,"$150,000 saved up in the bank."
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners49,INTJc,How our young people buying houses?
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners50,INTJc,"Well, what they'll do is they'll go to a"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners51,INTJc,"bank, they'll give the bank a little bit"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners52,INTJc,of money and the bank will give them a
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners53,INTJc,mortgage. The mortgage is and another
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners54,INTJc,name for that is a note. That's where the
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners55,INTJc,"bank says, ""Alright, we looked at your"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners56,INTJc,"job history, we looked at the money"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners57,INTJc,"you're making, we feel comfortable with"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners58,INTJc,"you, we're actually going to give you a"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners59,INTJc,"mortgage."" Which means we're going to lend"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners60,INTJc,"the money you don't put up."" So, let's just"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners61,INTJc,"say for a moment, you put up the typical"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners62,INTJc,"3%, 5% but for easy math today. We'll call"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners63,INTJc,it 10%. Let's say you came
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners64,INTJc,"with $15,000. Then the mortgage would be"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners65,INTJc,"for the difference. So, 150 grand minus"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners66,INTJc,this 10% down. Down as in down payment.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners67,INTJc,Would be the remaining balance of
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners68,INTJc,"$135,000. So, I"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners69,INTJc,"put $15,000 of the down"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners70,INTJc,payment. And there was
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners71,INTJc,"$135,000 mortgage. Now,"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners72,INTJc,that mortgage is going to come with an
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners73,INTJc,interest rate. Because the bank's going to
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners74,INTJc,"say, ""We're not giving you our money for"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners75,INTJc,free. You got to pay that back over time
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners76,INTJc,"plus interest."" So, the bank says, ""We're"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners77,INTJc,"going to do a six percent interest rate."""
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners78,INTJc,"And you're thinking, ""Okay, well if I'm"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners79,INTJc,paying this back over 30 years and I've
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners80,INTJc,"got that interest rate"", they'll do some"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners81,INTJc,math and they'll tell you essentially
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners82,INTJc,what your payment's going to be. Let's just
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners83,INTJc,assume for this example that your
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners84,INTJc,"payment is $800, okay? That's just a guess"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners85,INTJc,out of the wild blue. This $800 is your
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners86,INTJc,"mortgage payment, okay? Now, we've got a"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners87,INTJc,"home. It's a single-family home, it's not"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners88,INTJc,"a duplex, not a condo, it's not a"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners89,INTJc,triplex or multifamily it's just a home
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners90,INTJc,with one door and a doorknob and a happy
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners91,INTJc,family inside their windows and a
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners92,INTJc,"chimney like that. Now, let's say that you"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners93,INTJc,have this home and you decide we're not
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners94,INTJc,going to live there. We're going to rent it
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners95,INTJc,"out. Another word for rent is lease. So, we"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners96,INTJc,are going to lease the home. My mortgage
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners97,INTJc,is $800 but I might get my renters to
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners98,INTJc,"pay $1,000 a month. My mortgage payment"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners99,INTJc,is 800. My rent payment or my lease is
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners100,INTJc,"for $1,000 a month. So, this is my rent"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners101,INTJc,payment. This is my mortgage payment. And
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners102,INTJc,the difference is that if you have to
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners103,INTJc,pay the bank 800 every month but your
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners104,INTJc,"renter gives you a thousand, there's some"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners105,INTJc,leftover money. How much? A thousand minus
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners106,INTJc,800 is 200. What do we call that?
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners107,INTJc,That's called cash flow. And cash flow is
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners108,INTJc,"good. So, you buy a property. And let's say"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners109,INTJc,all the sudden that this house... I'm going
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners110,INTJc,"to throw you a zinger. Now, this house is"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners111,INTJc,"worth $200,000."
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners112,INTJc,"It's worth 200, you bought it for 150. You"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners113,INTJc,"put $15,000 down, you've got a mortgage"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners114,INTJc,for 135 but it's worth 200. Here's the
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners115,INTJc,question. How much equity does it have?
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners116,INTJc,What's equity? The equity is the
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners117,INTJc,difference between what it's worth and
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners118,INTJc,"what you owe. So, in this case 200,000"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners119,INTJc,"minus the 135 is $65,000 of equity. Does"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners120,INTJc,this awesome. Are you learning this
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners121,INTJc,language? You can rewatch this video.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners122,INTJc,These are the basics that you want to
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners123,INTJc,get really comfortable with. And
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners124,INTJc,"literally in the beginning, just copy me."
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners125,INTJc,Just copy what I'm saying because I'm
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners126,INTJc,"telling it to you the right way, okay? So,"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners127,INTJc,"I've $65,000 of equity, you might say, ""But"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners128,INTJc,"Kris, what about my $15,000"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners129,INTJc,"that I put down?"" That's not part of the"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners130,INTJc,"equity. Because you would get this $50,000"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners131,INTJc,out plus the 15 you put down.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners132,INTJc,The equity represents the total amount
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners133,INTJc,between what it's worth and what's owed.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners134,INTJc,"By the way, when you do investment real"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners135,INTJc,"estate, you're looking for equity and"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners136,INTJc,"you're looking for cash flow. So, I wanted"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners137,INTJc,"to, you know, teach you these basics, so"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners138,INTJc,that you understand equity is a very
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners139,INTJc,good thing. Cash flow is a really good
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners140,INTJc,"thing. Now, before we get to these 2"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners141,INTJc,real quick. Let's just do a quick summary
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners142,INTJc,on the story that we told so far. This is
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners143,INTJc,a home. It is a single-family home. Single
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners144,INTJc,dwelling. Meant for one family. It's not a
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners145,INTJc,"condo, it's not a townhome and it's not a"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners146,INTJc,"duplex, it's not a triplex, it's not"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners147,INTJc,"multifamily. And this house, at the time, I"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners148,INTJc,bought it for 150. It was worth 200. I
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners149,INTJc,bought it because it had equity into it.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners150,INTJc,"Right there I bought it it had $50,000"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners151,INTJc,of equity. 200 minus 150. But then I put
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners152,INTJc,"$15,000 down to now"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners153,INTJc,"have a mortgage of a $135,000"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners154,INTJc,and my total equity
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners155,INTJc,between what it's worth and what's owed
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners156,INTJc,"now is $65,000. My mortgage payment is"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners157,INTJc,800 a month. But I chose to
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners158,INTJc,rent it to somebody else. They're paying
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners159,INTJc,me a thousand a month.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners160,INTJc,That leaves $200 a month
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners161,INTJc,left over every month. That's called cash
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners162,INTJc,flow. Now a couple more things that
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners163,INTJc,you'll want to know so you can tell the
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners164,INTJc,"full story. This $800 a month, is that"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners165,INTJc,you're P-I-T-I? What Kris? Principal
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners166,INTJc,Interest
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners167,INTJc,Taxes and Insurance. A bank will normally
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners168,INTJc,wrap all four of these core components
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners169,INTJc,into your mortgage payment. The reality
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners170,INTJc,is that your mortgage payment on this
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners171,INTJc,800 might actually only be like 720. The
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners172,INTJc,other $80 might include principal
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners173,INTJc,"interest and then taxes and insurance. So,"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners174,INTJc,"your payment, when you make a payment"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners175,INTJc,"every month, a part of it goes to"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners176,INTJc,principal. That means paying off this 135.
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners177,INTJc,A part of it goes to interest because
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners178,INTJc,the bank's got to make money. A part of
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners179,INTJc,it has to go to taxes. They'll actually
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners180,INTJc,"say, ""Hey, we don't... You need to make sure you"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners181,INTJc,"pay your taxes."" Because if you don't then"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners182,INTJc,the county will put a lien on this
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners183,INTJc,property and that will encumber the
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners184,INTJc,property. Encumber means they're going to
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners185,INTJc,weigh it down and the bank says that's a
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners186,INTJc,threat to us because we only want our
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners187,INTJc,"loan to be the loan on it. So, every month"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners188,INTJc,we're going to take a twelfth of your taxes
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners189,INTJc,"every month. And after a whole year, we"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners190,INTJc,will have collective a year's worth of
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners191,INTJc,taxes. And we'll have it automatically
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners192,INTJc,paid off so that you don't get behind on
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners193,INTJc,paying your taxes. And then insurance. The
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners194,INTJc,"bank says, ""Dude, the house could burn down."
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners195,INTJc,You guys could be crazy responsible or
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners196,INTJc,"freak of nature, act of God, something"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners197,INTJc,"wild happens. If there's a flood, an"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners198,INTJc,"earthquake. And if that house gets hurt,"
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners199,INTJc,we need to know that our money's not
INTJc_Real Estate For Beginners200,INTJc,"just lost. So, we're going to have it insured."""

INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)108,INTJc,making $200 every month in cash flow
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)109,INTJc,"which is $2,400 per year we'll call it"

INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)115,INTJc,but there's more to that right because
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)116,INTJc,during that time your loan balance
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)117,INTJc,"dropped from owning owing like 80,000"
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)118,INTJc,that's actually dropped down because
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)119,INTJc,over time the longest paid down right so
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)120,INTJc,you started at 80 but in fact after that
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)121,INTJc,time you only owe about 78 five so
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)122,INTJc,you've made about fifteen hundred
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)123,INTJc,dollars just about on loan pay down but
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)124,INTJc,at the same time prices tend to go up on
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)125,INTJc,average so where the property was worth
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)126,INTJc,a hundred thousand dollars you now after
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)127,INTJc,one year we'll say on average three
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)128,INTJc,percent appreciation it's now worth a
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)129,INTJc,hundred and three thousand dollars so

INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)134,INTJc,four hundred dollars in cash flow so
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)135,INTJc,really during the first year you've now
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)136,INTJc,three four five sixty nine hundred
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)137,INTJc,"dollars you've actually added $6,900 to"

INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)139,INTJc,a millionaire yet but over time the cool
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)140,INTJc,thing is that this process speeds up use
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)141,INTJc,they're paying off more and more of the
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)142,INTJc,loan faster and faster and the value of
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)143,INTJc,that property goes up as well in fact if

INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)145,INTJc,paid down the other one going up if we
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)146,INTJc,were to erase this and which I do on one
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)147,INTJc,graph you can see that over time the
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)148,INTJc,value of the property we'll call this
INTJc_How To Become A Millionaire Through Real Estate Investing (Newbies!)149,INTJc,the value the property was that we'll

ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?14,ENFJc,renovated to then rent out and pretty
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?15,ENFJc,much everything I make is reinvested
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?16,ENFJc,into buying more properties so you could
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?17,ENFJc,say real estate has pretty much been my
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?18,ENFJc,focus for over the last decade plus I
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?19,ENFJc,remember just barely getting into the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?20,ENFJc,business in early 2008 as prices were
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?21,ENFJc,just collapsing into the abyss and
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?22,ENFJc,everyone thought that real estate was
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?23,ENFJc,just a fool's investment until it
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?24,ENFJc,started going up in price and then going
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?25,ENFJc,up a price even more and then even more
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?26,ENFJc,than that and now apparently we're going
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?27,ENFJc,to see prices collapse again so what
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?28,ENFJc,that said welcome to an article I just
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?29,ENFJc,read by the balance and in it they say a
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?30,ENFJc,survey found that 58% of people felt
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?31,ENFJc,like there would be a housing correction
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?32,ENFJc,by 2020 and as a result eighty-three
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?33,ENFJc,percent feel like it would be a good
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?34,ENFJc,time to sell the article even goes
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?35,ENFJc,further to explain that national median
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?36,ENFJc,family home prices are 32 percent higher
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?37,ENFJc,than inflation similar to 2005 when they
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?38,ENFJc,were 35 percent overvalued and yes wait
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?39,ENFJc,for it even more spooky statistics is
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?40,ENFJc,that 52 percent of home loans are now
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?41,ENFJc,originated by lenders who are not
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?42,ENFJc,regulated as banks then combine all of
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?43,ENFJc,that with the lack of affordable housing
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?44,ENFJc,and some other eerie similarities
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?45,ENFJc,between now and early 2008 and isn't
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?46,ENFJc,looking like we're heading towards a
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?47,ENFJc,real estate crash or is all of this just
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?48,ENFJc,another false prediction like they've
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?49,ENFJc,been saying literally every single year
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?50,ENFJc,since 2009 here's what I think first of
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?51,ENFJc,all going over the article they do
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?52,ENFJc,highlight two key points which could
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?53,ENFJc,have an impact on real estate prices the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?54,ENFJc,first one being rising interest rates
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?55,ENFJc,it's no surprise that when interest
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?56,ENFJc,rates slowly began rising last year that
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?57,ENFJc,the markets were not too happy and by
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?58,ENFJc,not too happy I just mean that the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?59,ENFJc,prices were going down this is because
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?60,ENFJc,as interest rates go up money costs more
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?61,ENFJc,to borrow which means people and
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?62,ENFJc,companies have less profit left over
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?63,ENFJc,which means they need to raise prices to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?64,ENFJc,off
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?65,ENFJc,set that cost and then when consumers
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?66,ENFJc,can't afford paying more they don't
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?67,ENFJc,spend and when they don't spend the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?68,ENFJc,economy doesn't do as well okay maybe
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?69,ENFJc,that's not the perfect example but
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?70,ENFJc,basically higher interest rates means
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?71,ENFJc,less profit for businesses and people
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?72,ENFJc,which usually isn't as good for the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?73,ENFJc,economy rising interest rates also mean
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?74,ENFJc,that real estate costs more to own as
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?75,ENFJc,well which means that people won't be
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?76,ENFJc,able to afford as much real estate as
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?77,ENFJc,they could previously like we could just
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?78,ENFJc,use this example here if you take out a
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?79,ENFJc,four hundred thousand dollar loan on a
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?80,ENFJc,house at a three and a half percent
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?81,ENFJc,interest rate your payment would be just
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?82,ENFJc,under eighteen hundred dollars a month
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?83,ENFJc,for 30 years but if interest rates go up
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?84,ENFJc,just a little bit to four and a half
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?85,ENFJc,percent then that exact same property is
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?86,ENFJc,now going to be costing you over two
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?87,ENFJc,thousand dollars a month over the next
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?88,ENFJc,thirty years that means you're going to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?89,ENFJc,be spending over two hundred dollars a
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?90,ENFJc,month more for the exact same property
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?91,ENFJc,with just a 1% difference in interest
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?92,ENFJc,rate so that means if interest rates
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?93,ENFJc,start going up real estate is going to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?94,ENFJc,cost more which means that potentially
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?95,ENFJc,prices might decline secondly the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?96,ENFJc,article also cited the new tax reform is
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?97,ENFJc,having a negative impact on real estate
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?98,ENFJc,values and I'm not gonna lie there is
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?99,ENFJc,some truth to this this new tax reform
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?100,ENFJc,just basically says that your state and
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?101,ENFJc,local tax deductions are capped at
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?102,ENFJc,"$10,000 a year and you won't be able to"
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?103,ENFJc,write off anything beyond that now for
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?104,ENFJc,the majority of people out there this
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?105,ENFJc,makes no difference to them whatsoever
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?106,ENFJc,but for people who live in high property
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?107,ENFJc,tax states or high property value states
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?108,ENFJc,like here in California it just means
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?109,ENFJc,that you're not able to fully utilize as
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?110,ENFJc,many of the tax write-offs as you were
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?111,ENFJc,previously the same thing also applies
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?112,ENFJc,to the mortgage interest deduction
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?113,ENFJc,previously you can write off the first
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?114,ENFJc,million dollars of mortgage interest
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?115,ENFJc,that you pay on a primary residence and
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?116,ENFJc,now that was lowered to seven hundred
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?117,ENFJc,and fifty thousand dollars now again
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?118,ENFJc,this is something that is probably not
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?119,ENFJc,going to impact the majority of people
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?120,ENFJc,in the United States but for people who
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?121,ENFJc,live in expensive homes this just means
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?122,ENFJc,real estate gets marginally more
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?123,ENFJc,expensive for those people however
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?124,ENFJc,despite this after looking through their
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?125,ENFJc,data there should really be a few main
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?126,ENFJc,takeaways in terms of how and when the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?127,ENFJc,real estate market might drop and then
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?128,ENFJc,from that how to protect yourself to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?129,ENFJc,make sure you come out ahead of it okay
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?130,ENFJc,profitable and of course smashing like
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?131,ENFJc,button if you haven't done that earlier
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?132,ENFJc,first when it comes to real estate it's
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?133,ENFJc,very important to understand
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?134,ENFJc,what they say is very true it sounds
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?135,ENFJc,super cliche but there's a reason that
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?136,ENFJc,they say real estate is mostly location
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?137,ENFJc,location location it's impossible to say
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?138,ENFJc,the entire real estate market is going
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?139,ENFJc,to be going down at value that's like
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?140,ENFJc,saying all stocks are going to be going
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?141,ENFJc,down in value without recognizing that
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?142,ENFJc,some of those stocks might just end up
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?143,ENFJc,doing incredibly well the same thing
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?144,ENFJc,also applies to real estate the thing is
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?145,ENFJc,real estate prices are heavily
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?146,ENFJc,influenced by specific market demands
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?147,ENFJc,supply of inventory and proximity to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?148,ENFJc,employment and all of those will vary
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?149,ENFJc,significantly from location to location
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?150,ENFJc,case and point in Boise Idaho prices
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?151,ENFJc,went up on average of fifteen point
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?152,ENFJc,seven percent in 2018 meanwhile all the
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?153,ENFJc,way in Baton Rouge Louisiana prices only
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?154,ENFJc,went up an average of one point seven
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?155,ENFJc,percent during that exact same time any
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?156,ENFJc,time you're talking about real estate
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?157,ENFJc,it's so important to understand that
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?158,ENFJc,this is such a localized market and it's
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?159,ENFJc,nearly impossible to make blanket
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?160,ENFJc,statements across the entire country
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?161,ENFJc,sure maybe a massive recession or out of
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?162,ENFJc,control unemployment or a steep increase
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?163,ENFJc,in interest rates will impact real
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?164,ENFJc,estate prices but ultimately it depends
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?165,ENFJc,on the specific region and every market
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?166,ENFJc,will react a little bit differently now
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?167,ENFJc,second in terms of housing prices
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?168,ENFJc,themselves it's really important to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?169,ENFJc,distinguish that many markets still have
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?170,ENFJc,not recovered from their previous
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?171,ENFJc,all-time highs when you account for
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?172,ENFJc,inflation prices just naturally rise
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?173,ENFJc,over time and as markets continue to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?174,ENFJc,develop we're going to continually hit
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?175,ENFJc,all-time highs and that doesn't
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?176,ENFJc,necessarily mean it's overvalued a third
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?177,ENFJc,a major point this article missed is
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?178,ENFJc,that for most people the value of their
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?179,ENFJc,home in the short term is not going to
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?180,ENFJc,matter to them whatsoever
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?181,ENFJc,here's the thing if you're buying a
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?182,ENFJc,property with the intention of flipping
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?183,ENFJc,it within a few years for a profit then
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?184,ENFJc,timing the market accurately is very
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?185,ENFJc,very very important but for everyone
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?186,ENFJc,else with the intention of buying a home
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?187,ENFJc,and living in it for 10 years or more
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?188,ENFJc,then the price it's worth between then
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?189,ENFJc,makes no difference whatsoever when
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?190,ENFJc,you're not planning to sell I think
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?191,ENFJc,that's the most difficult part for
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?192,ENFJc,people to understand because everyone
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?193,ENFJc,thinks to themselves I want to wait for
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?194,ENFJc,the market to crash and then I could buy
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?195,ENFJc,in at
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?196,ENFJc,place I'm just gonna wait for that here
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?197,ENFJc,is the boring reality though it's more
ENFJc_Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?198,ENFJc,important to lock in a price you can

ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]102,ENFJ,but I signed an agreement around it and
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]103,ENFJ,then the office got a little over a
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]104,ENFJ,thousand dollars - now the only thing
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]105,ENFJ,about this was I believe that I was on
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]106,ENFJ,like a 70 or 75 split and so out of all
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]107,ENFJ,that commission they had so many like
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]108,ENFJ,fees and stuff on top of that that they
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]109,ENFJ,took out of there
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]110,ENFJ,but anyways a whole year to make a
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]111,ENFJ,little less than two thousand dollars
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]112,ENFJ,that was my first transaction now my
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]113,ENFJ,second transaction I ended up leaving
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]114,ENFJ,that that firm and I went to another one
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]115,ENFJ,so here's my second when he looks a
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]116,ENFJ,little different than the one before
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]117,ENFJ,so my second one was done in May of 2014
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]118,ENFJ,so made of 15 so pretty much exactly a
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]119,ENFJ,year later I did my second transaction I
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]120,ENFJ,was at a different firm this one was for
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]121,ENFJ,one hundred and fifteen thousand I took
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]122,ENFJ,home two thousand seven hundred and
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]123,ENFJ,fifty dollars so literally you can see
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]124,ENFJ,that these properties were pretty close
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]125,ENFJ,in sales price but I took home
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]126,ENFJ,significantly more from that firm so the
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]127,ENFJ,good thing about this though is that
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]128,ENFJ,these were like a month apart and so I
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]129,ENFJ,was really getting my momentum going and
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]130,ENFJ,hopefully but then I didn't sell
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]131,ENFJ,anything for a while things kept falling
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]132,ENFJ,out so one of my last transactions of

ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]138,ENFJ,calculations serve me correctly my first
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]139,ENFJ,year in
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]140,ENFJ,at this point I'm just counting my first

ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]142,ENFJ,transactions so not really my first year
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]143,ENFJ,of being licensed but when my first
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]144,ENFJ,transaction started to the end of that
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]145,ENFJ,year I brought home a little less than
ENFJ_My First Year Earnings As A Real Estate Agent [ACTUAL NUMBERS]146,ENFJ,nine thousand dollars and that was the

ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate0,ENFPc,hi everyone welcome back to my channel
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate1,ENFPc,this is a little over here I am a real
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate2,ENFPc,sage and hearing Philadelphia so in
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate3,ENFPc,today's video we're going to talk about
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate4,ENFPc,the five most common objection handlers
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate5,ENFPc,in real estate and disclaimer I think
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate6,ENFPc,that being as a new real estate agent
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate7,ENFPc,it's gonna come across more often with
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate8,ENFPc,those objections however if you are in
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate9,ENFPc,the business for quite a bit of time you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate10,ENFPc,have more of a track record you are very
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate11,ENFPc,confident during presentations you most
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate12,ENFPc,likely won't come across those objection
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate13,ENFPc,on a site now if you know how to
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate14,ENFPc,prequalify your prospect before you go
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate15,ENFPc,on the listing appointment or just buyer
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate16,ENFPc,consultations it's gonna be a lot more
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate17,ENFPc,easier for them to trust you in order to
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate18,ENFPc,throw you with a bunch of questions and
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate19,ENFPc,objections as well alright so let's get
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate20,ENFPc,into the video the first objection that
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate21,ENFPc,I came across most often arose the agent
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate22,ENFPc,I will say is the seller ask will you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate23,ENFPc,cut your Commission however there are
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate24,ENFPc,two ways of handle that question one is
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate25,ENFPc,if they throw you that question in the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate26,ENFPc,middle of your conversation or in the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate27,ENFPc,middle of your listing presentation you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate28,ENFPc,can say mister seller Commission is 100%
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate29,ENFPc,negotiable I will cover that question at
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate30,ENFPc,the end of presentation that's the first
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate31,ENFPc,way of handle it and the second way of
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate32,ENFPc,handle it is no any other questions so
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate33,ENFPc,personally I prefer the second way just
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate34,ENFPc,because you know if you trust me
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate35,ENFPc,you let me do my job I will get
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate36,ENFPc,compensated of how much work I have put
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate37,ENFPc,in and there's no question about my
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate38,ENFPc,commission whatsoever
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate39,ENFPc,and to a seller the most important thing
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate40,ENFPc,that you should care about is your net
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate41,ENFPc,is how much you're gonna walk away my
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate42,ENFPc,commission is should not be your
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate43,ENFPc,priority so try to focus more on your
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate44,ENFPc,value proposition versus you know have
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate45,ENFPc,them focus too much on the question
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate46,ENFPc,about your commission second objection
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate47,ENFPc,that came across the most often I will
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate48,ENFPc,say is I need to think about it so at
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate49,ENFPc,the end of the presentation let's say if
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate50,ENFPc,they are not 100% sold on using you they
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate51,ENFPc,throw you with a question like okay well
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate52,ENFPc,I have to think about it
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate53,ENFPc,can't make that decision right away so
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate54,ENFPc,for me I will go ahead and I'll just
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate55,ENFPc,like peel the onion I'll go ahead and
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate56,ENFPc,ask them can you help me understand what
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate57,ENFPc,do you have to think about is it you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate58,ENFPc,know my product or is that me like as an
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate59,ENFPc,agent you don't think I can do I do the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate60,ENFPc,job or do you don't think I can help you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate61,ENFPc,get the net that you want it or are you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate62,ENFPc,not a so decision maker so by asking
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate63,ENFPc,them these questions you're going more
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate64,ENFPc,depth of finding out what the problem
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate65,ENFPc,really is for you to be a better
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate66,ENFPc,salesperson you got to figure out what
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate67,ENFPc,exactly the problem is and number three
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate68,ENFPc,is they sell are being very unrealistic
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate69,ENFPc,on the price let's say when you go on
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate70,ENFPc,the listing presentation the house
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate71,ENFPc,actually the fair market value is around
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate72,ENFPc,"250,000 however at the end they said"
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate73,ENFPc,okay well you've done an amazing job I
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate74,ENFPc,love your presentation but we were
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate75,ENFPc,"thinking about getting 300,000 for this"
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate76,ENFPc,home and when that problem occur
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate77,ENFPc,normally is you didn't really do the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate78,ENFPc,pre-qualification question ahead of time
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate79,ENFPc,before you go on that appointment
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate80,ENFPc,because when you are pre-qualified the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate81,ENFPc,prospect in this case seller you usually
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate82,ENFPc,ask them okay mister seller
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate83,ENFPc,realistically how much do you think a
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate84,ENFPc,buyer will pay for your house and if
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate85,ENFPc,right that then they said okay well I
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate86,ENFPc,"think the buyer will pay 300,000 for my"
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate87,ENFPc,house you should have a better idea
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate88,ENFPc,whether if it's appointment that's worth
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate89,ENFPc,going for you because the sellers is
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate90,ENFPc,definitely very unrealistic however if
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate91,ENFPc,that occurs during the listing
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate92,ENFPc,presentation what I will say to the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate93,ENFPc,seller is mister seller you may or may
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate94,ENFPc,not know the fair market value for this
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate95,ENFPc,property for this area is two hundred
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate96,ENFPc,two hundred fifty thousand you have two
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate97,ENFPc,options you can either list the price
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate98,ENFPc,that I suggest you to or you don't have
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate99,ENFPc,to sell it at all do you have to sell
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate100,ENFPc,your property and then you wait until
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate101,ENFPc,they answer the question if they have to
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate102,ENFPc,sell it or they don't have to sell it if
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate103,ENFPc,they don't have to sell that there's no
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate104,ENFPc,motivation there and even if you list
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate105,ENFPc,the house at 300 thousand you might not
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate106,ENFPc,even be able to sell it therefore it's
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate107,ENFPc,going to end up being as a charity
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate108,ENFPc,case and I don't want people to waste my
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate109,ENFPc,time like that
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate110,ENFPc,so most likely I won't take that listing
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate111,ENFPc,I would just walk out the door and
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate112,ENFPc,number four the most common rejection
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate113,ENFPc,I'll say is to most for Sale By Owner is
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate114,ENFPc,bring me a buyer so I have heard that so
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate115,ENFPc,many times and no matter how I try to
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate116,ENFPc,tell them that you know I've tried
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate117,ENFPc,different objection handlers like okay
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate118,ENFPc,you know obviously I'm in real estate I
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate119,ENFPc,work with a bunch of fires and you know
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate120,ENFPc,I do work buyers I don't know if your
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate121,ENFPc,house are great fit so I have to see the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate122,ENFPc,house first I used to use this objection
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate123,ENFPc,handler but it just came across a lot
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate124,ENFPc,more problem then I thought it would be
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate125,ENFPc,the seller most likely will have the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate126,ENFPc,wrong impression thinking that you'll
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate127,ENFPc,bring them a buyer which is a big no-no
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate128,ENFPc,because then you're gonna come across
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate129,ENFPc,like a liar so what I incorporate right
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate130,ENFPc,now if they throw me this question
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate131,ENFPc,telling me to bring them a buyer what I
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate132,ENFPc,will say is mr. seller
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate133,ENFPc,I don't work with buyers my priority are
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate134,ENFPc,my sellers so let me ask you this if you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate135,ENFPc,have a brain tumor who are you gonna go
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate136,ENFPc,for are you going to go for a general
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate137,ENFPc,doctor or are you going to a
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate138,ENFPc,neurosurgeon I go to a neurosurgeon
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate139,ENFPc,because those people are they focus on
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate140,ENFPc,doing what they do they're good at their
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate141,ENFPc,job and so I sell in your house if you
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate142,ENFPc,really want to sell your house the top
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate143,ENFPc,dollar
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate144,ENFPc,you go to a listening agent not a agent
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate145,ENFPc,that work both with sellers and buyers
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate146,ENFPc,so last but not least is the question
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate147,ENFPc,that they might say okay why I have a
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate148,ENFPc,family member who's also eating the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate149,ENFPc,business and I have to talk to the
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate150,ENFPc,family member make sure they're okay and
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate151,ENFPc,for me to answer that question I will
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate152,ENFPc,say mister seller both you and I know
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate153,ENFPc,that is not a true problem if it is I
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate154,ENFPc,won't be here in the first place so
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate155,ENFPc,here's the contract sign your signature
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate156,ENFPc,right there to be honest all these
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate157,ENFPc,objections are more of a mindset problem
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate158,ENFPc,if you are a new agent of course you're
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate159,ENFPc,gonna get more questions like that
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate160,ENFPc,however if you're in the business you're
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate161,ENFPc,practicing it more and more your skills
ENFPc_Top 5 common objections in Real Estate162,ENFPc,are more sharpen
