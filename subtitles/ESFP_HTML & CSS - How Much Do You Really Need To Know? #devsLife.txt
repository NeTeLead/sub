 strange fruit is what we're used to. that's me and [Music]. all right guys what is up YouTube it's actually Sunday morning right now it is about 7:00 a.m. and and I honestly wanted to make a pretty quick video for you guys but my last video that I uploaded I'm fortunate enough to be able to make these videos in my office right in my in my building where I actually wanted to make a living and it's really cool because my boss actually watches my videos which is really interesting right when you think about it because you're filming in the office it's funny we're actually talking about my youtube channel for about 20 minutes or so or something like that maybe 20-30 minutes or something around that and he told me how you watched my last video and he was talking about how he does like my he liked that video but does one point he didn't agree with and I'm like oh really what is it and I was really interested interested to hear because you know yes my experience he was a scene in front developed but he still called that work too he told me how when I mentioned in my video that it should only take you two or three months to learn HTML and CSS and he told me fairly quickly that that's something he doesn't agree with and I was very interested to hear his input on that there's so much in regards to internet and you know when it comes to HTML CSS because it's more than just building a Dom right and he gave me a really good point and so the question then is right I loan against this how much HTML and CSS do you really need to know like how much how much you need to know how much time you need to spend on it and this is something that I really want to talk about right now and I want to talk about this because almost everyone that self-taught our friend and developers a lot of them are they're back and developers too but a majority of them are front-end developers because that's usually what you think of when you think of code you think of what you can see that's front-end development but the question is how much do you really need to know to get off right off the bat you will never know enough not even just these languages are changing and growing but even more than that the Internet is growing the Internet is changing there are rules when it comes to even Google that you have to work with think coming on the internet that you have to be able to work around but one of the main ways you do it as being able to write effective HTML and effective CSS how much HTML CSS do you know in two to three you should at least be able to know how to build a regular basic website you have your body you are able to build just a website you put the paragraph elements you put your copy or text in there you you know you have a footer you have very basic great that stuff it's not easy to make as a first-time coder being able to build a navbar and then within two to three months you should make it a goal to make it mobile friendly and the basics right now I'm so not really intricate but now out of two to three months after gifts and this what my boss told me after someone even learns that code in two to three months now to get even better and he's a senior developer okay seen the front-end developer now the goal then to be someone who's really good HTML CSS and take what she wrote that website that you made in two to three months using HTML CSS that made a mobile-friendly now do it all over again this time don't even use a tutorial okay he didn't say that I'm saying this right now but then what he said is this now do that again what you made that website but now use less CSS let's shoot that's true right now do it again and see if there's a way to use even less HTML does that make sense dan you said now do that same thing but make it load even faster and so with the point that he was getting at is that you cannot learn enough HTML CSS in two to three months to become really good at that these type of things they're doing this kind of work on the internet and the web takes you here is an experience and making mistakes and learning from your mistakes but that is what what development is all about it's not just making something simple but you get the job done dawned what the heck okay I bet you get the job done but now the goal is how could it do the exact same thing even better how can you make it faster how can you make it a load from page to page and do the exact same thing or JavaScript okay so you just learned JavaScript and you learned how to how to page on the click you learn how to make something load after three seconds right you and how to do different things we found a page with JavaScript now do the exact same thing which you didn't JavaScript but using more less code now try to make the page load even faster now try to implement Ajax now how do you implement that Ajax call even faster now and you does that make sense that's the whole point of this is that how much HTML CSS do you need to know you'll never know enough but the big important factor is how well can you use it because anyone can build a website you could just use Google to make a website with no coding experience is very easy I'm gonna make a video on that soon but the question then is how good are you are using it how effective are you are using it and if I was gonna add my own input to this as well as how much attention do you spend a detail which is something I need to work on even more than ever to be honest right coding it's more than just building its building things well and not even that taking something that was built very well and make it even 60% faster 40% faster make it work look amazing even on an iPhone or an Angela or whatever browser you're using right that is how it needs to know and I know there's no I'm giving you but how much HTML CSS you need to know you have to know how to make things better if they learn to be effective with it if you're able to do that and know JavaScript as well people would be crazy it's not hiring you people will be going after you why because not many people think that way let me know your thoughts if you disagree let me know anyway I'm end of it you hear alright guys thank you for watching just Kashan lipo developer and I'm out peace
