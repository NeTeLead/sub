going on topic I feel like a lot of people especially the audience I've built over time might not like but it's definitely something I think they need to hear and it's something I definitely need to hear but refused to for a long time so hopefully this does educate some people today's video is going to be on apologies or more so unapologetic culture unapologetic conservatism began around the time of Donald Trump obviously I think a lot of people just decide it was time for conservative unapologetic movement people could be unapologetically gay and have gay pride people could be unapologetically black and have BLM but naturally during the time of Trump more people came out as conservative and more people came out as unapologetically right-wing which I 100% support I think people have the right to express themselves to be proud of who they are but at some point we have to ask ourselves when does unapologetic culture get in the way of our morals when do we become so obsessed with not apologizing we forget to do the right thing by almost fear that this unapologetic culture is an excuse not to own up to her own mistakes for example as everyone knows I deal with mental illness on a daily basis PTSD depression anxiety there have been times past where I've used my mental illness as a crutch or an excuse to act out inappropriately but I can't do that I'm an adult I have to own up to my mistakes I have to say I'm sorry for acting out and apologize from inappropriate behavior and what better examples than my own mistakes I have been on YouTube now for less than two years almost one and a half years and I've definitely built a certain type of audience and a certain type of narrative I have noticed recently that with the change of my views and ideas and opinions people have been kind of getting angry with me and sort of questioning why I'm changing as a human being which is odd because as humans that's what we're supposed to do oh I look back at my past behavior in this past year and a half and what was wrong with me I have definitely done and said some questionable things that I'm not sure where my actual beliefs or just the need to build my own ego and a lot of things what I did definitely played into this unapologetic conservative culture and it's not just issues with the left its issues with myself in the right wing its issues with things I've said things I'm worn things I've done the past that personally I don't think applied to my own morals things that I've said and done that don't apply to me spiritually I know a lot of people are gonna be saying Ashton don't give in to the left or apologize the left be a true proud Patriot but this isn't about the left is about personal morals that I have gone against this isn't about apologizing to the left or making up something for myself this is simply about owning up to my mistakes and being a mature adult about it but apologetic behavior has allowed us to point the finger at the other person not own up to our own mistakes and to me that's extremely dangerous to both our spiritual and mental growth as human beings I am NOT a perfect person I have emotional meltdowns I have acted out emotionally and possibly I think the best thing I can do for myself is to apologize learn from my mistakes and become a better person and frankly these past two years I have been involved to politics than YouTube I haven't been very courageous or kind I was so drowned out by the likes and the retweets and the internet culture and my own narrative I forgot what I really stood for allowed an ego narrative to completely control where I was going in life such a high ego for myself I forgot where I was morally I allowed myself to be led by an ego and not by God it's so interesting to me about Christian conservatives they say oh don't apologize be unapologetic but aren't you the same people who say that it's your job to pray on your knees every single day and ask God for forgiveness and here's the thing yes you should be unapologetic about who you are as a person you she proud of who you are but I wouldn't be proud of Who I am if I didn't learn from those mistakes I've done in the past and apologize if I never learn to take responsibility for my actions in the past how can I grow to be the person I am today how could I be unapologetically proud of Who I am right now after learning from my mistakes it's okay to not apologize for things you haven't done wrong but if you morally inside believe hey this is not okay what am I doing with myself that is God telling you you need to own up to it apologize a lot of people say not apologizing is what makes you strong but what if I told you acknowledging what you've done wrong and learning from it makes you even stronger I just don't want to live in a world without change and growth and understanding that we're all human and that we all make mistakes and we can all change over time how can we expect the world to forgive us for our mistakes if we don't apologize for them first I have definitely made quite a few mistakes in the past two years that I am NOT proud of and I want to say I'm sorry for that I'm sorry for not listening I'm sorry for not being opened up to a conversation I'm sorry for not being as mature as I could be I'm sorry for getting into useless drama I'm sorry for not controlling my emotions and acting impulsively most of all I'm sorry for having such a high ego I didn't realize this then hopefully that I do now I can do something for the better I am NOT a perfect human being we're not perfect human beings but I definitely believe we can learn from it and grow from it my name is Ashton god bless and be seeing you [Music].
