 hello everyone my name is Poonam and welcome back to my channel in today's video as you can see I'm gonna talk about my experience in Korea and how is it like to be a foreigner especially being brown person in a place where everyone's very very different from myself okay first of all it takes around 15 hours to get to Korea from me tell you or any country of Europe I guess mostly will take around 14 15 hours from Italy to Seoul so just teach you bring some books 20 get on the plane because you will get really bored especially because I personally got really bored do you know you can't watch movies for a full you know his trade and you can't even sleep because you're so excited sitting next to this man for 14 hours straight and he did not say anything not even worried not even hello [Music]. [Music]. victory so he slept for almost ten hours and the remaining hours he ate he went to the toilet he looked at his phone and he did not say a word to me for all those 14 hours which was very strange because usually when you are sitting next to someone for a long journey you get to talk to them you get to hear about their life you talk about your life you know stuff like that but in my case that didn't happen so other things that I know is about Korean people because most of you people there watching this video must know about Korea thanks to the popularity of kpop and yes Korea you didn't know I know I was here Oh. kpop is such a discovery it was a huge discovery for me. um being an Indian we have Bollywood which is very extravagant and very colorful but kpop well it's a different you know Korean it's just not about kpop it's just not about kdrama it's much much much more there is a huge culture is this huge background of history traditions and architecture as well as you can see these are the traditional Korean houses and another thing that Korea is well known for is of course the fashion and I can either be traditional fashion or modern and of course the food which is really really amazing so before going to Korea did some of my research about how Korean people react to North Koreans especially to somebody that looks very very different from their beauty standard saying I was very worried about how people will react to my appearance and how people would think of me because I didn't want to be creative side for how a little car I'll suffer because somebody can judge me for how I look but thankfully I've been very very lucky that didn't happen and honestly I think that nowadays Korea is getting extremely extremely used to foreigners for years there are just not white people but also black people are brown people so they are very acceptable so they don't get shook if they see somebody that is black or brown I mean they are of course they if you depends on the places you go if you go in a very small city in a very small village of course they would react in different way but if you go to Seoul or if you go to Gwangju it will be like just normal daily life you don't have to feel different or people reacting to you in a different way of course they have mean stares people staring at me but it wasn't nothing too intense it was a good stirring like trying it to you and and of course never ever smile to someone is carrying it to because that's not good manners you you never smile to somebody who stares at you in Korea but of course the staring happened I got lots of stairs but it was nice I mean I too like getting attention I think all girls like getting attention of course has to be in its own limit too intense as I was probably expecting it was it was nice attention nice turning if you can say so so one of the things I notice about Korean people is their sincerity Korean people are extremely extremely straightforward sometimes there are so much straight forward that it can get too much Laurens are Russians I've been there Karen Raye if you received some compliments from a native Korean that means that those compliments are very very true and that you deserve this compliment we got into compliments I got quite a few compliments but some of them were really really unusual I will say I remember a couple of girls tapping on my shoulder and stopping me on the road and telling me you you have a very small face and I was like okay um thank you and of course I knew that if a Korean person tells you that you have a small face it's a very very good compliment because one of the beauty standards in Korea is having a small face I just say the same thing to Italian people they will think you are making fun of them because small face means small brain and which basically means you're stupid but in Korea if you have a small face you're lucky if I got that compliment a lot and that happen in quite times where people will just tell me that I have a small faith and they would tell how do you get a small face what do you do to get a small because they are kind of obsessed about having a v-shaped face a small face so that's why they always make photos like this or like this so they can like you know I'll sling down maybe their feet not that thing that I loved there is a huge variety of food so you don't have to worry if you are either vegetarian or non-vegetarian or vegan and you have lots of choices to choose from if that makes sense and I remember asking to my boyfriend how much time do you think it will take foreigner to taste all the Korean food and he said around almost two years so which means there is huge huge variety of food I think in the night time is so beautiful it's so gorgeous it just became transforms into a different city compared to daytime with all these lights and me and sign and especially in the weekend it gets really popular with youngsters hanging out having fun eating street food so you will definitely enjoy the night time in Korea cos it's just so beautiful and so different it's pretty much all I would love to say about my first impression things that I loved about Korea and I hope you enjoyed this video and let me know if you want to know more or you can give me suggestion about what you want to see next and thanks for
