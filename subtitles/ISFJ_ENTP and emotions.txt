 I'm playing some background music so that you get entertained why I talk except I think that I'll be a little distracted okay so today I wanted to so the other day I by the way made my plant Bebo if anyone knows that reference well good for you but yeah so today I wanted to talk about being an INTP and dealing with emotions the other day I was on reddit and I kind of put this post I was talking about how I have troubles with my emotions basically it was the gist of it and I bought a lot of pop votes and people were like well I really I was like you know what let's make a video about it if people kind of understand then you know why not so that's what I'm doing if you couldn't tell and that very necessary beginning was not necessary hence making it unnecessary wow I'm so smart but so today I wanted to talk about emotions and how it is a weird situation for me I've been thinking about like this for a while now but I was like is it too insane that I think this way I mean I'm obviously not gonna 100% contributed to being an entp but I I mean since other entp is related to it I guess it must have some truth truths to it yeah so it was basically just that I don't really understand emotions like I don't understand happiness and I I experienced it but I don't understand it I have the hardest time really interpreting what emotions mean you know so many times I'm angry or I'm upset I usually don't know why it is the case I and that's all I do know so I I tend to like eliminate the entire process of you know check what what's right and what's wrong like I don't know a song okay I heard it once before anyway I'm kind of distracted okay they're real so much better I can focus now on what I'm saying okay so it was basically just that I experienced the emotions but I can't really express them and I don't understand that I was talking about this to another friend of mine who I think is an ENFJ or Ian TJ I think and I was trying to him by this and well then he asked me to join his cult which is basically where you know parts of your brain but it was a joke yeah so I just don't know how to interpret emotions I mean I don't want to sound like typical oh my god look at me I am a thinker and I don't know how to understand emotions you know feelers go away like that's not that's not what it is because I I mean I don't know I feel like there's a stigma on thinkers and feelers I can totally see why but it's just not that I'm saying that it's accurate but I can see why the stigmas surrounds that but I guess my basic concern is that like I don't know how to interpret what I'm feeling so I'm thinking about the this the other day and I don't know what I was feeling but I was like hmm I don't understand why this exists you know I don't understand why it is that certain I certainly like things happen in your life and they automatically either well I don't know how sadness works but I guess it's like really are less release of serotonin or more you know or like something's happening you're like well my brain decides to automatically release more dopamine or serotonin whatever it is you know it's just I find the concept very weird because it's like how does your brain even know how to release what when all the way experiencing it but like I guess if we further continues conversations gonna go on margin existential ish maybe situation but it's basically just like I don't understand how I'm supposed to into breath what I feel you know like like you should most of the time I'm just confused and like I know that I'll be feeling down but I I can't I can't pinpoint why is it is that I would be feeling now or sad or depressed like I think a few months ago I had this like depressive phase I thought I was depressed but I well I disagree now I don't think I was it was just it was a very intense space but yeah it's just like I don't understand and and that's why I don't know again I don't know if this is an intp thing or it's just like my thing I I just can't interpret the fact that the things that I'm feeling and I'm supposed to process them for some reason so I just I completely eliminate that part it's like I I usually like even the so many times the you know people will ask me you know this does this happen what's your opinion on it and I'd be like well I don't know and it's so difficult for me to come to conclusions because it's I look at everything from every angle so even if someone does something awful i i will obviously look at the victim side but at the same time i also look at the the criminals perspective so i guess it just it comes down to really how do i feel about something I don't know do I have opinions about things yes I do but they're mostly not based on what I feel they're more based on like what I guess what's more I don't know I guess again my opinions also aren't that strong so in their very momentary because the people I I keep switching to many things like for instance I was giving this example so the beginning of this year I was religious um but then right now I am an atheist and I'm sure that that will change because I'm exploring everything but it's it's so hard for me to come to a conclusion and it's just and I usually never know how I feel about things I know how I you know think about things like I don't know if that sounds weird but it's just it's such a weird concept you know it's so it's I don't even know how to explain it it's that's how abstract I feel that it is because it's so difficult to explain this because it's like what really it is it yeah I personally myself don't really understand hence the entire video con um but yeah I just I don't get it this video is literally just eight minutes of me saying I don't get it you know I guess that's like an issue and I think that's like an entp shoot I saw like again I posted on reddit and I was like what do I you know how do I do something about this and they're like well I don't know well you know they usually talk about why it is like make like a mental checklist or like the commenters who comment my post there they basically told me to checklist in my head mentally what happened and why is it that I felt the way that I found which I mean you know it's it's very logical and it should be easy to do but it really isn't because I was trying it the other day and and it just I just find it so absurd but also so fascinating that we experienced things and then these experiences like affect us you know I for some reason that's like a very fascinating concept to me that's all I have to say about this peebo and I will see you the next video if you would care to join subscribe if you want to I have some videos about being an intp although i'm an entp but I thought I was an INTP so there at the back of the plane not playlist there like the older videos if you want to see some recent INTP videos well they're more recent so you'll see it and I also made this MBTI thing you know I was like a beehive and mines if you want to see that then I'll put it on screens over okay bye
