 hi and welcome back to entp life in today's video i'm here to talk to you about what does emt-p life mean anyway a lot of you out there think that entp life stands for the entrepreneurs life and even though that's what it may seem like it's really a nod to my myers-briggs personality type and I really wanted to make a channel that highlighted this personality type so give the public a real example of what it's like to be an entp now for those of you out there who aren't familiar with the myers-briggs personality types there's sixteen personality types that every human being falls into for those of you who don't know your your myers-briggs personality type I think the best thing that you should do before you've been continuing with this video click away take your myers-briggs personality test and let me know in the comment section below what your personality type is and what you thought about the results now go on over to 16 personalities calm and take that personality test before you continue on with the video when I took this test I was blown away because it characterized me exactly as I am I always just thought I was enough right I thought I was just a disorganized crazy guy and when I took this personality test it really put everything into perspective for me and explained it in a way that I could understand it showed me what my common traits are my train my weakness is how I am in relationships how I am with my friends how I am with my family and what I should avoid that isn't really conducive to my personality type what personal effects I really work with and this tool is something that I actually use in my company what screening employees and when putting together teams to work on projects because every personality type has their gifts and every personality types has their precursors and this channel is really meant to highlight that now people with the intp personality type are also described as innovative clever and expressive dntps are also known for being idea oriented innovators visionaries and debaters one kind of popular emt-p that you guys might know or might be able to identify with this tyrion lanister on Game of Thrones he is the quintessential entp he has you know a broad sense of knowledge and a lot of different areas the gift of gab and it's actually really good at motivating and dissecting and really seeing the big picture of things but he also lacks focus he's always drinking and whoring and you know kind of interested in too many different things that he may fall off or I guess lose his horse now I had another channel here on YouTube actually the channels called hooking up at the channel that's focused on on cooking and I started to realize that hey you know what I'm not just a one-dimensional person who only has an interest in cooking I want a channel where I could just talk about whatever it is that I want just to give you an idea of how many things that I'm qualified in or highly skilled in I'm going through the book I'm a pilot hip hop music to be sure CEO of a home health care agency x-ray tech cascade technologist auto body specialist fashion photographer product photographer I founded a fashion technology company called style scam if you guys even google Salkin it was a fashion social network that allowed people to post images and categorize them by brand category category and color and youtube personality just add it to the list okay and what happens with me as as a person is that I take interest in a lot of different things and I'm able to also in my mind connect all these different things and make them almost related I could almost create an analogy for it for anything and so many things function on the same principles or the same rule so I'm able to learn things really quickly and I'm able to really hyper focus one problem with the emts personality type is that since we're able to get a track that's a lot of this danger like that the guy who chases the shiny thing all the time we may start something that we are passionate about everybody knows it and then one morning wake up and say I don't feel like doing that and move on to the next thing we're really good at making money and often times set to not really know how to keep it and I could see where that's true is because when we're passionate about whatever it is we go in we're able to say okay I have this passion project I also know how to monetize it etc but since we're so horrible at maintenance type work and repetitive work that once it gets to be routine and mundane we would rather kill ourselves or lose all of our money everything that we invested just to avoid doing the repetitive work so how has that affected me and my person that and in my personal life or in my business life well what I know is that my attention span is about six months okay so if I'm going to be starting a new business or a new project or whatever the case may be I know that it needs to get to the point of stability where I'm able to hire people to to continue to run it or I don't do it right if it does if that can't happen in six months I don't even get myself involved because I know that I'm not the type to stay with the same work for two three four years building organically you know whatever I get myself into has to be able to scale to a point that it's it's able to run itself within six months or I'm able to hire employees at that six-month mark and be cashflow positive and continue to grow that out if it if it doesn't have that potential I absolutely know that it's gonna end up crashing and failing because I'm not gonna be that interested beyond that and what happens is after I've been away from something long enough it starts to get my interest again so I come back around and say okay let me check in on this business and see how it's doing and what I do now that that's really good for me is that the businesses that I do get myself involved in I'm looking at setting up the structure in a way that at that six-month mark I'm able to kind of move on to something else but I do come back around and set a plan for the employees who are in place who are working work for pushing the idea further who could even work better than me they may not be as innovative they may not be as clever they may not be able to find the hacks in that industry but they're able to execute on the original plan and what you're working and then when I have the new innovative idea and the new thing that I want to layer on top of that existing business I come back around talk to my management team get them motivated again and do it all over again and by doing things that way I'm able to move from one industry to the next to the next and continue to innovate and continue to grow without imploding on myself other intps are known to kind of have the same patterns and and almost become the guy that has always has that great idea that like that crazy uncle who's always inventing things but never really kind of gets past that because they never realized that hey this is what's going on with me and never structured or set themselves up to kind of protect themselves in those pitfalls so if you're an EMC C personality type and you've been struggling with consistency guess what that's totally normal for your personality mate what you need to do is pair yourself up with the ESF days of the world these are the workers man they're the ones that will you just give them a recipe you give them the plan they'll do that every single day and take pride and joy in that right I've had partners and a lot of employees for ESS J's and we work really well together because they're able to take my direction take my orders take my plan and execute them we also work with some of the other personality types really well that kind of supplement where every week so in taking that personality test and figuring out what your strengths and weaknesses are you're gonna be in a better position to know what the characters are gonna need to look like or who they're gonna need to be in order to have success in whatever it is that you're working on so I'll hope that explanation into the emt-p personality type really helps you understand one why the channel's name - what it is and - that your personality type is something that is hardwired in you and that if you understand it and you know the positives and negative that personality type if you're gonna be able to go out there and put together the best possible team around yourself so that you're able to execute at the highest level possible you need to know what your trades are you need to know what your weaknesses are and you need to be able to supplement for those weaknesses so that you have the best game possible now if
