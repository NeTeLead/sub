 hello it is late at night and I felt the sudden urge to film a video so pardon me if I don't exactly look fresh as a daisy because it's been a long day of writing it so it's been amazing but with my friend but hi yes but I also wanted to do this so what a creative day that's awesome those feel good I'm sure you guys have those too Mike my other fellow creatives where you just you do a lot of one day and then some days you don't write it all and you think oh no but I'm trying to write every day I will say so um a few things before I get into my main topic is I made a list because there's a couple things I want to touch on today my list there it is so number one let's just make a list I think they've done a study or something that people enjoy list or that they will click on the websites with Liz I believe it I do it's easier sometimes even though it makes me feel like the lazy reader lazy person but it also helped me to just quickly consume the information hmm okay so number one I know actually you come to think of it this is information I do not need to share on the internet it's funny I just realized I'm like hmm for my safety nope not doing that it's just something fun I do it it's just something I do let's just say as an individual to make sure I am safe that I thought was unique but they want to see what I feel good but I will serve him number two. please check out Auto Alois channel he and I did a well we've done a few collaborations now but I jumped on his typewriter series because I am a writer and he wanted to interview an ENFJ find out our process and kind of strengths and weaknesses and all that good stuff so I don't know when the interview comes out once I find out I can post it in the description box below or in the comments or somewhere you can find it um if you can't just give me a hollow say yeah hey we're back a bad buy off I don't see the date so yeah I don't know when but I think you guys should check it out I think you'd really enjoy it you get to see an ENFJ and an auntie P interacting which is always fun I think it's I really like the chemistry between enfjs and auntie peas they're really they are good at bouncing ideas off of each other I think and good creative partners so that was fun it was a lot of fun to film Thank You Jeffrey so my main point point number three the race is that I realized welcome to Charm School I realized that I flip and love our YouTube family I feel like we have a little YouTube family and it's pretty neat it's almost like we kind of come from a similar soul family or something that's very enough of me but it feels like soul family you guys feel like home and what triggered this is okay so Frank James has a new channel which you should check out a fare YouTube content creator it's really good as would be expected right it's Frank James so it's called College of tuber studies and he breaks down the whole shabang about being a youtuber and how to be a successful youtuber because it is hard y'all I mean if you are in a content creator let me tell you that everybody makes it look easy it ain't easy even someone like me that doesn't do crazy edits and by crazy I just mean maybe more than one or two edits because I only do a few at a time I know it's just some of my videos are probably boring because it's just one singular and I thought until I have a day like today we're in very any yeah so it's nice to get his perspective and to get some tips and tricks and because it is it really is challenging to keep yourself motivated to edit the videos to to you know think of things you want to say I mean although I do have a whole have a whole notebook of things that I'm keeping track of but still some of the topics you write down but then you think I don't know I don't talk about this today I don't know I'm not feeling it so I like to keep it to things that feel good at the moment yeah you hear ye so yes Frank changes College of tuber studies where other content creators are coming in droves and learning from the best right and so I noticed Sean I on a PhD you commented and in his on Frank's new channel and it was just so heartwarming to see people connecting sake Frank is connected to Frank is connected to myself and Shaun and I'm connected to Shaun it's just like a cool triangle and then it just goes from there right so I just thought oh my gosh it's our little youtube family or um it's really neat and knowing everyone's personalities it's it's really really heartwarming and so I just wanted to tell everybody how amazing you are whether you have a channel or you just comment or subscribe or you liked or disliked or just watch the videos which I tend to do I tend to not leave comments thank you thank you for all of you for your contribution in one way or another your time your energy all of it and your talents those have collaborated with thank you this has been wonderful and there are time so I want to give up like everyone else and then I just realized I have to keep going this is actually making a difference I wanted to make a difference and yeah it isn't in the way I would have expected behind the camera but by golly if it works it works so um that note hey I have a song for everybody I was thinking you know I was gonna do musical musings by myself and that's like I don't know maybe I will at some point but I found a fun song but I I think I've heard and where say I probably heard it in college but I just we can applaud once more we circled back round and it is called vampire wedding I believe and it's it's these are either by Andre 3000 or Outkast you think but I mean vampire wedding song if you google that or whatever or Spotify it I'm sure it's I think it's probably the only one or you know one of few but it's catchy so I'm not around random note my Holland mug did all right stay with my friend.
