 hey guys what's up and welcome back to my channel my name is renee if you're new hello and welcome today's video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys my story on my anxiety I'm gonna go through kind of like my childhood how it all started how I'm dealing with it maybe some tips and tricks at the end on how I cope with anxiety I think this is a very very important video to make for myself just because I think it's so so important to talk about mental health I think a lot of the times people will you know hide their mental health or hide their feelings or their emotions and I think the more we talk about it the more normal that becomes and the more that we're able to get help that we need so I just think it's a really overall great topic if you guys are comfortable with it comment down below your anxiety tips and tricks' or maybe your story to kind of get people to feel more comfortable about opening up and speaking up about their problems I think it's really great so definitely do that if you are comfortable with that today's video it's going to be sponsored by better help I partnered with them before better help is an online counseling service that makes getting online therapy

you to better help for sponsoring this video I'm gonna go ahead and dive into opening up about my mental health and my anxiety in particular um because like I said I think it's really important that we discuss it and get it out in the open that way other people can you know do the same and feel comfortable doing the same so I'm gonna go ahead and start as a kid let me grab my coffee I got myself a cinnamon Dolce latte so cheers to that pretending that it's like fall right now but it's not um but basically I was born I was the oldest child I have a younger brother and I never like remembered having anxiety as a kid but I have watched videos like from when I was younger and I was very very quiet and shy and very soft-spoken as a kid especially like when my brother came just because you know when there's a baby in the family like everyone's kind of attracted to the baby so when someone was like giving me attention I was kind of like standoffish I guess are like shy because I wasn't really used to it um so maybe that is kind of where a lot of it stemmed from I don't know but that's just something that I personally noticed I never had anxiety like through elementary school if you guys are subscribers of mine you guys know that I talked to a therapist now um and we kind of pinpointed I guess some issues that have come up in terms of my middle school experience that I wasn't aware of which is another great thing about therapy is like you'll find certain things about what triggers you or why you have a specific problem that you were never aware of to begin with um so it's really interesting in that sense because I was like bullied in middle school bullied I mean like I think everyone kind of was picked on I just had a specific person that I was like friends with but really they weren't really my friend they were like I don't know I mean I think they were my friend but like they were like mean you know and I'm not gonna dive too deep into that but basically um the way that she had treated me kind of paved the way of like why I'm afraid to be myself around people why I kind of build up a wall why I'm kind of quiet and reserved because when I wasn't or when I was myself I was ridiculed judged and completely bullied for it so that's something that I kind of came to the realization of like why I am a certain way around especially like new people I didn't know that as a kid that like I had just recently kind of had an aha moment with that I have a lot of anxiety in terms of like being around people I don't know if it's social anxiety because when I'm around people that I like love them that I know I really am NOT anxious at all it's usually around like huge crowd of people that I don't particularly know and I'm kind of in a closed-off space like if it's out and this is really weird but like if it's out in the open I'm totally fine but like if it's like in a very very closed space like where I can't exit the room like I get a little bit anxious actually a lot of bit anxious and it's just something I've dealt with my whole life I don't know like I just so even as a kid like I was I don't know I just don't like being around a lot of people especially people that are super like have big personalities I tend to kind of get like even worse shy or like worse in my little bubble and looking back into like my middle school time it's kind of like the reason why I'm like that is because I'm afraid of being judged and I'm afraid of like people picking on me or I'm afraid of someone you know calling me out or something so for me something else that I noticed about my anxiety is that I'm really good in terms of like starting fresh like if I have a new start where I don't know anybody or I feel like it's a new start I am so good at like starting over and like being totally okay like that's when my anxiety like goes down is like when I'm kind of in a new space so for example when I went to high school I was like in such a good mood I was talking to tons of people because it was a new start for me and I knew that like I could make myself be whoever I wanted to be and I could be myself without you know hiding that and so when I went into high school I was exactly that in middle school I never like really wore my hair down because like I was afraid that people are gonna like I don't make fun of me or something like that's like I would always have my hair up I never wore my hair down because I was afraid that like people would like make fun of me if I put my hair down or something or if I try something now and so in high school like I went into and I was like I'm putting my hair down I'm straightening I don't care I'm just gonna be me and people would like say oh my god your hair is down and I'm like yeah I don't care like you know like I just felt so good I had a close set of friends in high school and then it kind of peaked again because in sophomore year one of my closest friends ended up like completely bullying me like I had the worst high school experience she totally shifted the experience for me and I think that triggered it a lot and I thought like triggered it so bad like to the point where I would go into the classroom I usually put my head down like I wouldn't talk to anybody I was just like don't talk to me like I just feel so uncomfortable right now like my social anxiety peaked in sophomore year I think because I lost a close friend and because the repercussions of that like it wasn't like we just stopped hanging out like she flat on bullied me or her older friends who were like it right above me bullied me and it just totally closed me off and I just like didn't really trust anybody in I felt like that was the worst it's ever been like even to this date that was the worst it's ever been and so when I was a junior in high school I got into like a really bad car accident with my mom which kind of gave me the feeling of like not really caring and I was just like oh my god like I almost died like why am i caring about this you know stupid thing like when you have a near-death experience like that's what happens it's like you just look at life a different way but it kind of reversed my anxiety so now instead of social anxiety it was more stemmed towards like anxiety - like danger if that makes sense so like I always would like it super anxious like driving in a car or like putting my seatbelt on which is just totally normal in terms of like dealing with the traumatic car accident but also like just little things like if someone knocked on the door I'd like freak out or if I wasn't supposed to do a certain thing like I'd freak out because I wasn't like following the rules like I'm in danger and like everything just peaked in that sense but the social anxiety kind of like died down and also the fact that high school was ending and I was gonna get out of that place and then I met someone that was like very carefree and non judgmental and so I just kind of did my own things in your year and I was feeling like the best I'd ever I didn't care about you know what other people thought about me our social situations like if anything I kind of was more geared toward social situations and I felt really really good that was like my favorite year ever like I just like totally came out of my bubble and I was just myself and I was like loving my life and then I went into college which again having that new start not knowing anybody I was just putting myself out there and letting myself be me for once and I was like needing tons of people going out like going to college like all these new experiences I met Noah like it was just a really good time in my life and I felt like I got some sense of control over you know that because I I went into college a certain way and I kept it going throughout college and then when I moved back home after college I had a panic attack at a Trader Joe's which if you guys watched my vlogs I'm sure you guys know that too and there's a difference between panic attacks and anxiety attacks so panic attacks happen out of nowhere like there's no real reason as to why you get them and it's like kind of like fight-or-flight you get adrenaline you don't really know what's going on and you feel like you're gonna die like it's the scariest freaking feeling I've ever felt in my freakin life but it wasn't really stemmed from anything and xiety attacks is like when you hyper yourself up and you get super anxious and you can't breathe and like everything's kind of just closing in on you and you're just like freaking out but you got yourself there based on like the way you're thinking so there's a difference so the panic attack that happened at Trader Joe's there was no rhyme or reason as to why it happened but now anytime that I'm in a situation that is like the situation that I had at the Trader Joe's for example in grocery stores and a line waiting in lines like checking out I freaked out to the point where I give myself an insight a attack and that totally triggered like my anxiety I don't know I'm just getting super anxious my heart palpitates for no frickin reason I stay in my house a lot I don't go out very often um and finally at the beginning of this year I kind of was like I'm sick of this like I'm sick of like living my life like this and I'm not gonna let this affect me and I need to get help you know so I reached out to somebody I got a therapist and we are currently working on it and I definitely feel so much better since I've gotten help um and we're definitely getting it not solved because I don't think like you can ever solve it but it's getting it under control and I'm becoming you know better at being myself but the main thing that I have issues with now is that in social situations I tend to put up a wall is what I was told by my therapist is like I have a wall because of things that happened in my past like the middle school situation in high school situation where I don't let people and very often I get really quiet I don't really like people immediately and I like only a certain amount of people and those people that I do let my wall down around is very very few which is not healthy because I'm not able to you know get to know people and have them get to know me because I put up a wall and I instantly judge them because I know that they're gonna judge me in a second based on my past I don't know it it's just like what my mind thinks is like this has happened before in the past if you yourself around them they're gonna make fun of you they're gonna judge you they're gonna talk about you they're gonna you know put you on the spot and that freaks me out and so I have a wall my problem is when I let my wall down sometimes I let my wall down too much to the point where I'm like super nice and friendly I talk openly about my problems I get really close to people really quickly and then they do judge me and they've mistake me for being weak and I've had people recently walk all over me completely walk all over me to the point where yeah guess what I am gonna put my wall up like I don't want that but that's not a healthy way to live and you have to understand that just because they put you down like that that is not anything to do with you and it has nothing to do with my past I think about it it all has to do with what they're going through in their life and they're kind of projecting whatever they're feeling and their insecurities onto you maybe they're walking all over you and judging you and making you feel this way because they deep down have insecurities about feeling weak and not strong and and their way of dealing with their anxiety is to kind of come off a little bit too strong and like put you lower in order to make them higher so never ever ever this is like one of the biggest tips ever is to take anything personally which is what I used to do all the time when something happened to me I would think it was my fault I look like an idiot I'm doing a certain thing wrong I'm being like whatever they're telling me I'm being but that's not the case you're just being yourself unapologetically yourself and they're projecting their issues onto you and whenever anyone is mean to you like snippy with you or angry with you most of the time it has nothing to do with you and it's all to do with whatever they're dealing with imagine yourself you know in a really bad mood and your significant other or your family or your friend comes in and you just like snap at them like you didn't snap at them because they're making you upset you snap to them because your day has been shitty and you're just in a pissy mood and so yeah you took it out on them whether you know it or not intentionally you weren't meaning to be like that towards them it's just how your day was progressing and I'm not saying that's okay you shouldn't do that but at the same time if someone else is doing it to you you have to understand like don't take things personally because whatever they're projecting onto you is most of the times what they're feeling inside which is actually really sad so if someone's being mean to you like maybe they're upset and angry with something going on in their life and that's why they do that to you another thing that I was taught in therapy was the understanding of cognitive behavioral therapy so basically this all stems from your thoughts which you guys know I talk about a lot of my channel I understand the power of your thoughts but it's something that I personally have struggled with like without knowing if that makes sense so what my therapist says it's like a circle so you have you're activating event up here you have your thought from that activating event that thought gives you a certain feeling and those feelings make you behave in a certain way so for example the activating event that happened in my panic attack at Trader Joe's is I had an irregular heartbeat like my heart skipped a beat which is like I've had before but I guess like my brain after that activating event you're dying when you tell yourself you're dying you're gonna feel like fight-or-flight like oh my god I'm about to die and then behaviorally I like felt like I was gonna die I ran out of the store I almost fainted like that was my behavior because it all stems from the thought if I have the irregular heartbeat and I thought oh that's weird my heart skipped a beat hmm and my feeling would just be like oh that's a little weird and kind of like maybe being a little bit cautious and my behavior would be like okay it's like just keep going throughout your day like check out like a normal person you know let's say another activating event is somebody bullies you or something your thought process if you're thinking oh my god something's wrong with me they made fun of my hair is my hair frizzy or whatever they said to you feeling wise you're gonna think oh my god my hair is frizzy I gotta put it up and your behavior is gonna be like I'm putting it up I'm gonna cuddle down and get like all shy and like get awkward and uncomfortable but if the activating event is someone's like your hair so ugly and they're bullying you about your hair and then you go over to the side and you think wow they must be really really upset like maybe they have insecurities about something going on that they have to project onto me feeling wise you're gonna feel sorry for them and your behavior is gonna be like damn like I'm gonna be nice to them and guess what they're gonna return the favor and be nice to you probably and if not you look better and you look more mature anyway so it all stems from that initial thought the act of any event you can't control but you can control your thought which in turn controls the feeling as well as your behavior so whenever you're feeling anxious or that the anxiety kind of start speaking and you're feeling it look at what am I thinking right now are you thinking like crazy thoughts and I've talked about those two before another example is like he was described my therapist was like if you drop a gallon of milk at the grocery store like you're dropping a gallon milk and everyone's like looking at everyone's looking at you see how my thought stemmed to that everyone's looking at me but first of all that's not even true because how do you know everyone's looking at you you don't you just spilled the milk maybe one or two people are looking at you but you don't know everyone's looking at you that's a false statement you're saying a false statement too which is gonna make your feelings and behavior act based on everyone's staring at you which is not reality you're giving yourself a false reality by what you're telling yourself maybe you can say oh I spilled a gallon of milk this person is coming over to help me instead of saying everyone's staring at me this is so embarrassing like tell yourself oh this man's helping me like that's really sweet like oh and this guy's staring at me there's one guy staring at me that's it a lot of the times the thought that we tell ourselves is completely false and nothing to do like it's not even true at all it's just what we tell ourselves we tell ourselves an exaggerated version of reality that is most of the times false so when you have that anxiety stemming up look at your thoughts and say first of all is it true you know and second of all are you exaggerating the truth and third of all is there any way that you can kind of make the thought less daunting and more positive so that's just something I deal with another thing is to not label certain things I am a huge label er I have found out I'm also a very black-and-white thinker so I will label it you know good or bad or there's two different extremes and for example I went to a party recently where I got super super anxious and I thought of that situation as being oh my god I had anxiety like I failed again like why am I like this like all this stuff I labeled it as you were super anxious but the fears that I have in terms of social situations didn't happen at all no one put me on the spot nobody like made fun of me or judged me or anything like that they were completely nice and friendly and so instead of labeling the situation as oh my god I had really bad anxiety why don't I turn that around and label it as well my fear didn't happen that that the reason why I have social anxiety I have certain fears of things that will happen based on what has happened in my past but none of that happened in that party so why don't I label it as a success because none of that happened none of my fears happened yes I was a little bit anxious but it was success in terms of what I'm afraid of because none of the fears happened it was a good-ass party like I just had a little bit insight that's it so I when I switch it around like that it helps me look at situations in a more positive light and next time I go to a party I look at the party that happened previously as none of my fears happened and so I go into the next party feeling a okay and more comfortable and less anxious but if I look at it as like Oh last party I was really really anxious guess what I'm gonna go into the next party thinking oh my god I was really anxious last party so I'm gonna be super anxious again like it's gonna heighten my anxiety so see how your labeling situations and then the last and final tip that I have for you guys is that it's kind of morbid but it kind of helps me is that life is gonna end like we are all never gonna be here like we are all gonna die eventually like all of us right now that are living on earth are eventually going to be dead like humans are gonna be gone earth is gonna die our son is gonna die there's gonna be absolutely nothing in the universe so why are we sitting here like making huge problems we we are only here for such a miniscule amount of time like why don't we just take advantage of it and like live it to the fullest another thing I think about is like in terms of memories like one day will be like 80 years old rocking in our little rocking chair thinking about all of our past memories and do you want to remember them as being like I didn't go out and enjoy that my life to the fullest because I had anxiety or I let my mental health get in the way of it or do you want to say hey like yeah I had that but I still went out and I still experience things whether they were good or bad embarrassing fearful anxious sad whatever the case is like you you experienced it like your memories you want to look back guys like I took advantage of that situation I lived my life in my 20s my 30s 40s 50s whatever the case is and you don't want to look back and be like yeah I was in bed all day because I was too afraid to like go out and live like you only have so many days here like just make good memories you know I don't think anxiety is something that we're ever gonna cure I think people have anxiety whether they think they do or not I think it's very very common it is very very common but we just need to talk more openly about it because when we do that you're kind of less afraid and more like connected to people because you're you have something in common with them and you're not an outcast or you don't have to feel guilty about having mental health issues you know you can live with them and deal with them and like be open with them and not let them rule your life and you rule them you know it's corny as that sounds so I just think it's a really great topic to talk about and I think we should be talking about it and not be afraid of it or embarrassed by it you know this is a bit very hard video for me to make I don't really necessarily like I'm happy that I have it I'm not sitting here like bragging about my anxiety yeah it's a little hard for me to talk about yeah the time that this video is gonna go live I'm gonna get a little bit anxious but you know I'm doing it for the better good and I think like we all should do that you know and I think therapy is something that everyone should be involved in and it's really sad to me how expensive it is and how unreachable it is but better help does you know help it be more reachable to people who you know can afford therapy or can't make time around their schedule for therapy so it's a really great idea highly highly recommend if you guys are interested again link is in the description thank you so much to better help for sponsoring this video and getting me to talk about this openly and thank you for watching this video I hope you guys got something from it or feel less alone again if you guys are comfortable with it or you guys need
