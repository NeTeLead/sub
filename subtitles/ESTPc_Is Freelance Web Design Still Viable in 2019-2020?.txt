 hey welcome to the vlog so I'm gonna answer a question put to me on Instagram I work in accounting full-time at a tax sass company I have been teaching myself to program on the side I just watched a YouTube video how can freelance web developers print money in 2018 and was curious if you think this is still the case for the end of 2019 2020 he continues it seems like everyone wants to learn data science AI and machine learning I'm trying to choose a freelance path but I could specialize in I wanted to see if you think Web Design would be a good path I have an associate's degree in graphic design so I'm familiar with HTML CSS JavaScript I would like to start programming with Python because of the versatility then pick up others as needed ok first question do I still think that Web Design for freelance is viable in 2019 2020 it's becoming even more viable couple reasons a there is an unprecedented amount of freelancers in the economy now across North America and Europe probably around the world I'm not talking about web programming so long I'm just talking about general-purpose autonomous workers people are working on their own their own businesses whether it be in the tech space or outside of the tech space this is the trends I forget the exact numbers but it has jumped quite a bit in the last ten years or so and it continues to accelerate so all these independent contractors and small business owners if they don't if they don't already have a website they're gonna need a website so that's clear a little advice and not regards if you're gonna get into the freelance space it's good to know a little bit of back end even if that's not gonna be your focus understanding a little back in so you can set up servers maybe implement a simple shopping cart system implements of their party libraries etc etc this will help you in your career there's no question in terms of freelancing most freelance clients are going to be small business owners so these are common requirements that they're gonna need throw in a little WordPress knowledge and you should be good to go lots of clientele that said what you're going to learn as a freelancer generally speaking as a coder you're gonna have to learn as you need need to need learning it's par for the course in the tech space so that's why I say concentrate on fundamentals so that you can jump around and learn technology as you need to learn it so there you go with that next AI machine learning this is big but it's still in the early stages I don't see that there would be too many freelance jobs in that space probably lots of work working for people full time but in terms of AI machine learning I don't see it as a freelancer thing yet it kind of reminds me of web design and development in 1994 it really started to take off in 96 97 in terms of freelancing because remember back in the day when I started freelancing I think it was 96 it's actually 95 in fact a lot of times I would approach companies and they would I would say she get a web site and they would say what's what's a web site they didn't know machine learning AI people know what it is but we don't exactly know exactly how it's going to be implemented in a small business context a large business of course would be hiring people full-time so it's not necessarily a free lapsing although they could hire freelance contractors to take care of some AI machine learning stuff that they may need to do if you learn Python you want to do freelance hit the web stack and then on the side start learning about machine learning opportunities there are libraries and frameworks that you can leverage so you don't have to do a deep dive into machine learning but generally speaking I think these days if a web is in terms of freelancing is the way to go so I gave the first reason why web freelancing is big because websites are just getting more and more important because there's so many independent contractors out there and small business owners there's a period four or five years ago give or take where people are looking at websites as being less important they were looking at better to build your social media presence like on Facebook or something but things have changed we've seen how Facebook can take people down they ultimately control your presence on their platform so smart business owners and all business owners trying to realize it's much better to have your own website your own space on the web and then have satellite Facebook presence Instagram presence YouTube presence and so on so I think there's going to be a continued rise in the importance of web design development web professionals as they call them because the skill sets of a modern web freelancer is shifting slowly but surely shifting but it was in the 90s is very different from early 2000s very different from well kind of different from mid late 2000s it's pretty stable but there are new things coming into play now so there you go I hope that helps bye bye.
