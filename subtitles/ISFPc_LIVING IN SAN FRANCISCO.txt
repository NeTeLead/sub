 what's up guys it's Elizabeth Murray here back at it again with another video and today I just kind of wanted to talk about living in the Bay Area all of god what it's like and kind of my journey since I've been here if you guys have not already don't forget to like this video and subscribe to my channel and I'll just be putting out more videos about what it's like living in the Bay Area as well as doing vlogs about certain things to do if you already live here or if you're visiting things like that um as far as my journey here in the Bay Area or San Francisco I moved to San Francisco about nine months ago first things first by living situation right now I live in a two-bedroom two-bath you have one roommate and we live in a 710 square foot apartment two got to give you guys a perspective on you know how big our apartment is and this is pretty standard actually so if you're from Texas where you know that's where I'm originally from 7-10 square foot costs you know like a regular one-bedroom apartment for one person actually even bigger than that there's not a lot of space and so they kind of like try to maximize it with not giving you know not having a really big apartment space or house whatever whatever it is it's it's not too small I mean it kind of reminds me of my college apartment so it's definitely doable so a little bit of background about myself so I moved out here from Texas and uh I left my car in Texas because my apartment charges about three hundred and fifty dollars a month for parking and I was definitely not about to do that so I left that thing in Texas and so basically my main means of transportation is Lester uber and also carpool so carpool has really saved my whole entire life but cuz my commute from work from my house to work is about about an hour and hour and a half depending on traffic and taking the train here it's actually really expensive it's that it's the opposite of you know other cities so other cities if you take public transportation it's way cheaper than you know taking a car right but here it's the opposite like if you have a car it's actually a lot cheaper to get around and taking the train and I don't get it I don't know why everything is just more expensive here whatever so I've actually been using on to apps Waze carpool and scoop and they essentially match you with other people who have similar commutes and they pick you up close to your house or at your house and then they also drop you at work or close to work so it's been a lifesaver for me because when I first moved I was taking the train every day and maybe spending about 40 dollars a day just solely on taking the train just because I had to take a looper to the Train take the train and then take an uber from the train to my job and back so all of that added up and it was just it was a nightmare so I thought that is a tip for you guys if you are already live in the Bay Area and are struggling with your commute or are planning to move to the Bay Area and don't know what you're gonna be doing as far as transportation so that's also an option for you they also have another option in uber called uber Express and that essentially makes you walk like a block or two from the location that you enter in and it is essentially like essentially it optimizes the time for the driver as well as the rider that you're riding with and it saves time basically so um that's also an option that they have here that that they don't have in other cities so I originally knew San Francisco was a lot colder than on the rest of California however I really never thought about how much colder was gonna be it literally is you know low of 50 high of 60 pretty much the whole year and a lot warmer so right now it's October end of October and it's now starting to warm up so it's now finally starting to get into the high 60 high 60s and I'm literally living my best life because I'm from Texas you know I'm used to thinking soon so coming out here you know I was like yeah I'm gonna California pack my shorts yeah I know I I don't think I ever wore my shorts all here to be honest like I'm literally always in jackets it's like pants you know whatever so but it's finally warming up now end of October and I'm really happy about that they call it the Indian summer so um yeah it's definitely we got our summer but it's a lot later than the rest of the country I will be doing another video on like my apartment tour just so you guys can kind of see on you know how an average-sized apartment is here and San Francisco though those are the main things that I wanted to talk about today don't forget to thumbs up to this video subscribe to my channel and I will see you guys the next one bye
