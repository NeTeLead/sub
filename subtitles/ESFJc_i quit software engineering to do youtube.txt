 hey long time they see I'm really excited to be back but I feel like there's something I need to address much better also I quit my job all right so this video is gonna be a little bit different or it's gonna be what you've been expecting the whole time I don't know I'm not a mind reader anyway the title isn't clickbait I really did quit my job for those who had no idea I spent the last 6 or so years as a software engineer and then an engineering manager in the tech industry in San Francisco and I've worked at a couple of companies but for the past two and a half years I've been working at this like little startup that then became a bigger startup called patreon it's basically a membership platform that makes it really easy for creators to get paid thanks jack this past Friday was actually my last day at patreon all right al unemployed and I left to do this you know have my videos demonetized for a living I originally planned to have this video be this like big production with a bunch of fancy editing tricks and stuff but I didn't feel like it so I didn't I've also already made a couple of involved videos about leaving engineering and becoming a manager and joining patreon I'll leave those videos in the cards here and like the description down here as for my decision to leave the industry as a whole it's weird because for me it always felt like super scary and risky but all of my friends and basically everybody I know has been super supportive ever since I posted my first video so what's my problem making things for a living has basically been a dream of mine ever since I was a kid so what's the holdup like why was it so hard for me to take that leap especially considering it had become financially possible to do so like with the growth of the channel and the fact that I spent the last year burning myself out trying to do two jobs well the short answer is that I'm a little baby and I'm scared this is my mom she wasn't my birth mom but she raised me from birth you know her name was Sharon and she was like my biggest fan even back before I had really done anything she made me feel like I could do anything in the world you know like moms in like she was my everything she was so supportive of me in everything that I did like one of my first big interests was drawing I used to sit for hours when I was a kid and draw like my favorite cartoon characters uh-huh I still got it still can draw a little Goku she would always you know put my drawings on the fridge or into a photo album or something that was really encouraging that was my first introduction to doing like anything created I also had a typewriter that I got from a thrift store and I would use it to type up scripts of like fake Dragon Ball inspired story is essentially fan fiction and actor them out with my friends on the street now that I said that out loud I think I was LARPing but yeah that's basically the reason I still reptile to this day it's like I thought in this frame alone there's a bunch of Goku's she'd also take me to like yugioh tournaments across town where as a 10 year old I would consistently get trashed by college students but you know she still took me every weekend she can even drive me herself because she had cerebral palsy cerebral palsy cerebral palsy cerebral palsy palsy cerebral palsy she couldn't even drive me herself because she had cerebral palsy which I could barely even say let alone imagine living life with but she always found a way to make it work this is me and my mom when I was in fifth grade on the day that I was given a citizen of the Year award from my City which I can only assume as a consolation for not being cool in elementary school and then a little over a week after this photo was taken my mom was taken from me she passed away due to complications from a stroke I wasn't even home when it happened I I was staying at a friend's place and i√≠ve kind of always wondered if things would be different if I had been there you know I would replay events in my head and I always felt really guilty that I didn't appreciate her as much as she deserved mostly because I was just like a punk kid like the last thing that we disagreed about is so dumb she would ask me to clean my room this is a reasonable thing and I would always just be like in a minute because I was a chronic procrastinator and I I also had undiagnosed ADHD at the time but she loved me all the same this loss like really stayed with me I essentially developed a fear that like in an instant my whole world could come crumbling down and losing the person that I was closest to I felt really alone and I also think it made me really averse to risk because I wanted to make decisions that reduced the chances that I would experience that kind of loss again that was when I was 12 and the next six years were some of the darkest in my life but I left my hometown when I was 18 to go to Georgia Tech and I basically never looked back for college I actually got a scholarship to help me afford out-of-state tuition because I didn't have any money and I was like my family couldn't really help me out financially but I still graduated with about $40,000 in student loan debt which it probably could have been less if I knew anything about managing money but I was 18 and there wasn't anybody telling me how to do things College was a really amazing experience though cuz it helped me learn to be on my own and how to make sense of myself in the world so big ups to the College of Computing at Georgia Tech for giving me a community and helping me feel less alone it was also super difficult because I was really afraid of being stuck with debt and not being able to get a job out of college so I took my life like full CS curriculum the core curriculum for my computer science degree and like the first two years of college I don't recommend it but I ended up getting an internship at Google which granted me the privilege of and I do mean privilege of interviewing with pretty much any tech company Under the Sun at that point because why vet a candidate if Google the infallible company that's never done anything wrong has already done your work for you I don't really mentioned this yet but I did really enjoy my major I loved the projects that I was working on in school and out of school and fons and as a teaching assistant i was basically living sleeping and breathing code which is exhausting to think about now but it really helped with the whole career thing especially considering that I didn't have any background in computer science or programming before I went to college at this point I had my heart set on a long and successful career in the tech industry because being successful it's the goal right I think I have this deep need for external validation and to some extent we all do because we tend to live lives that don't deviate too much out of the norm out of fear of being judged I would assume at least that was the case for me a lot of people asked me if they should major in in computer science and I can't stress enough how much of a coin flip it was for me and the fact that what I studied was valuable to the market like there's so many times that I got lucky in this story I almost majored in psychology and I I'm still really interested in psychology but I basically just like flipped a coin through college I was basically keeping any creative aspirations to myself in high school I had like a podcast and a YouTube channel hello all and welcome to the very first and pilot episode of the random podcast with me your host Jarvis the amazing Illinois I made shirts and made forum signatures and did all this like creative stuff but in college I think that's the fell to the wayside partly because I didn't have time partly because of the fear of public failure that I talked about my first video and partly because software engineering is I think a creative expression and I was able to funnel my creativity through building like apps and systems but eventually a few years after I was already in industry and thanks in large part to a breakup I started doing the improv comedy which took me back to my glory days of LARPing in the street and after some very aggressive budgeting I paid off my student loans and was comfortable joining a riskier company like patreon which was a start-up with like 4050 people at the time which is very different than the thousands I was used to it these larger public companies but it was so rewarding to work on things that Kina Grannis and Hank and John Green and Jake and Amir were using which is all well and good but it was actually the people that I met while I worked at patreon that I think gave me the creative confidence necessary to make such a big leap people like. and my eco every day is a good day for pants every day is a good day for peace and Jack who always be grateful for sitting down and talking to me about like YouTube strategy and the creative you know worries that I was going through when I had 2,000 subscribers on YouTube and I thought it was all over for me these people were thinking about creative businesses and the people that run them 24/7 but a bunch of them were like really accomplished artists in their own right and and them accepting me made me feel I guess a little more confident in my own creative output like I never sang in front of people but there I was like at patreon jam sessions on Fridays trying to hang or even like performing at our holiday party [Applause]. regardless of how you feel about patreon as a company and a lot has changed in the past few years I owe a lot to to the people that I met there you know going back to YouTube despite the channels growth over the last year which I never would have expected like seriously I said to myself I get 10,000 YouTube subscribers I'm done I did it I'm still really hesitant to do it full-time like I have a pretty intimate understanding of various creative businesses and they're hard and around the same time that stuff started really blowing up with the channel stuff started blowing up at work in the bad way and the workload of doing both became really unsustainable I wasn't doing anything but working and I missed weddings and forgot about birthdays and I spent Thanksgiving Christmas and New Year's by myself it's fine I promise and my mental and physical health were deteriorating all in service of like keeping the ship afloat so many of these videos over the past few months were recorded at like 3 a.m. because that was the only time that I could get it done and I basically reached the breaking point at the end of last year where I had a decision to make do I take a leap of faith and do this YouTube thing full-time or do I keep going on this engineering career widget I mean by all accounts is going great and it's much safer as well it was like a head versus heart decision but I guess I had built up enough creative confidence and just confidence in myself in general to take a calculated risk so I put on my notice in November but I I stayed on until last week to to wrap up some projects and I was basically still coding up until they took my laptop away at 5 p.m. on Friday and Here I am on the other side of that decision living this cartoon of in existence so to complete the poem of my life I made a patreon at patreon.com slash Jarvis don't expect anything fancy but it's there if you want to help in unemployed boy trying his best speaking of trying my best I got all kinds of merch in clue des some that I don't make any money on so if you can't afford the other stuff or you just don't want any money to go to me that's an option I don't mind either way in all honesty despite a lot of thinking about this I'm still very nervous and I have no idea how it's gonna go I just want to make sure that I can do this sustainable for as long as possible so please don't get mad at me if I put a mid-roll ad in in some of those 20 minute videos or do you do more sponsorships still figuring all this out and also hope to produce more regularly and hire an assistant editor so if you're a fan of the channel and you want to help me do some video grunt work hit me up at Jarvis Johnson biz at gmail.com as for why I'm telling you all this careers are weird they're meant to seem linear and straightforward but they aren't they're twists and turns and you never end up where you're expecting to get and that's where I'm at things are always changing so I think it's okay to be open to that change in life is all about calculated risk like I'm sure I'll seem like a genius if this really works out and if it doesn't there's gonna be a bunch of people saying I told you so but fuck it cuz I'm doing it for me I'll also call it that I'm extremely privileged in order to do this a lot had to go right in my life's Rube Goldberg machine for this to even be an option and everyone's situation is different I just wanted to call that out as for the tech industry itself my leaving is pretty bittersweet like I don't think the tech industry is perfect in fact there's a lot of issues that I have with it but I still really love it and I'm really optimistic for like the future of technology and society so I'm still going to be posting on my second channel definitely more frequently now because I've got a lot of time in fact there's a gonna be a video coming out tomorrow with more of a behind the scenes look at my last day which might look a little familiar for people who are old school fans of the channel on this channel I have seen that tweet from Sonny Dee and I implanted to talk about brand twitter again next week so thanks everybody thanks for sticking with me through all this I'm really excited to see where things go and to to my mom. I miss you and Jean every day and look I finally clean my room. I'll see you next week. [Music] you
