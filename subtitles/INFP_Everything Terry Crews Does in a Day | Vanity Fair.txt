 hi I'm Terry Crews and this is everything I do in a day I wake up in the morning at 4:45 a.m. I have a vibrating alarm that vibrates my pillow there will be no snoozing in Terry cruises office right after I get up I go downstairs to my kitchen and I have a very very complex vitamin routine I also set out all my other vitamins for the rest of the day I have vitamins three times a day in fact I'm holding one of the little vitamin baggies right now the prove this is the truth since I don't eat too - I have a shaker Cup with amino acids and water this gets filled probably four to five times a day and it's pretty much a gallon by the time you get done now I purposefully purposely do not check my emails or phone until I have finished my workout I dunno grooming before I go to the gym you're going there to get funky anyway I don't want to talk to anybody so if the breath is bad that's where you go I do a five-minute warm-up then I put on a audio book that I'm going to listen to the whole time while I'm working out it can be about business it can be about health it can be about acting it can be about whatever then I go to my first exercise and that depends on what day it is Monday legs Tuesday is just an arms Wednesday is stretch and abs and run Thursday to my back Friday is usually about shoulders and plyometric exercises I usually do four sets with ten descending repetitions so it will go 10 8 6 4 and I usually try to go as heavy as I can but then every workout every day ends with a four mile run if I'm going to Brooklyn nine-nine I get in the car sweaty my kids have complained they really like you are funky and I know it I get in the car I go to Brooklyn nine-nine and I shower there after the shower make sure the head is steamy and the room is all screaming and then I you do my shaving because this is the deal I am not really bald but I shave it every day and I do I have the exact pattern that down exactly how I do it then I put Old Spice aftershave on the top of my head and then I use Neutrogena oil all over my body because I don't want stretch marks I've always seen good you know big lifting guys get stretch marks but I get oiled all the way up I look like a nice slick machine it's kind of why I can do my whole grooming process probably in 30 minutes I do not have an assistant right now I've had assistants in the past but now I've learned to use a lot of apps this is cool app called lug if I have to move something from one place to the next you can push this app and all of a sudden to move or show up with the truck and can move things from one place to another even in your own house it's the easiest best thing ever and I'm one of those guys that has decided that my life is going to be at pointa I do not eat my first meal until 2 p.m. so an 8 hour window with a 16 hour fast I usually have a go to lunch which is an omelet with bacon and a salad and I always have that in my fridge and then I wash it down with a protein shake so by that time I've had my second vitamins and I'm ready to continue the second half of my day I have different things that I want to focus on so I'll get on the computer I'll check out tutorials I'll do some drawing some painting some studying I'll study my lines because the kids come home probably about 3:45 sometimes we play games sometimes we just hang out sometimes we decide we're gonna go watch a movie or what dinner is gonna be we make that decision usually by 6 o'clock but there's always a suite somewhere like I'll usually have a pie or a cake or something sweet some pudding maybe a little Pinkberry on the side you know what I mean we usually wind down after dinner we'll watch something usually that's on the DVR my wife always gets on me about this but I like to watch anything I'm in it's really really narcissistic yes it is i watch Brooklyn nine-nine I want you several times over again we watch old everybody hates Christmas all the time and everybody is like Julia are you watching yourself I'm like yes yes because this is a dream I'm living the dream and I'm gonna watch the dream I am usually usually getting ready for bed by 9:00 along with the kids and I'm in bed by 9:30 I do not wear pajamas to bed I like getting dressed up but at nighttime I get dressed down but I also prepare my clothes for the next day because I drink so much water during the day I will get up at least twice during the night I'm getting old I definitely get in between seven and eight hours every night I love going to bed early that's the thing if I'm up at like midnight I'm miserable it's funny the people in Brooklyn night and I will tell you if we ever have to shoot late I'm not a happy camper not at all all right and I'm Terry Crews and that is everything I do in a day
