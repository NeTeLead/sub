 what's up concern here and welcome to a brand new video here on my channel can I just start out this video by saying that I absolutely suck at dating so I don't even know why I'm making this well yeah okay so today's video is all about love. [Music] maybe I should relax a little bit now one question I get a lot is sunny what do you look for in a guy and that my friend is pretty complicated why well I'm a complicated person okay maybe not that complicated but at least I'm picky and that's mostly because of some previous experiences that I've had easy as that so for you guys today I have what I look for in a guy [Applause] [Music] number one a good sense of humor did you hear about the Italian chef that died he passed away now usually takes me about one minute to know if the guy has the same sense of humor and that is mostly because I use sarcasm a lot but a great sense of humor is really important to me because I love having a good laugh and just having fun and smiling in general it also most certainly brings out a better side of me and it makes me feel super comfortable number two something I really like is when guys are a little bit spontaneous nothing crazy but just like a hey it's 10:00 p.m. wanna grab some food or just like hey wanna meet up in 20 minutes like I would definitely say yes to both of those I'm also very spontaneous so yeah number three is passions I find it really attractive when a guy is passionate about something whether it's skating cars making music training or whatever anything really as long as you're passionate about something I find it incredibly attractive and the reason for this is that when I like something I usually get really passionate about them number four is good grooming this is very important to me and I take it quite seriously myself just shower fix your hair brush your teeth wear clean clothes hygiene is always important and I don't even know why I feel the need of talking about this but it's just like not everybody does it and hirable like to me this exact thing is just common sense but that's certainly not the case for everybody number 5 is confidence now this one is a little bit tricky because i'm shy' myself but I really enjoy when a person can make me feel comfortable by just having a simple conversation I really like when a guy can take away my nervousness and that's only possible if they're confident so just be confident number 6 has to do with respect and by that I specifically mean that a guy respects what I do I really like when guys pay attention to what I say and show interests in what I do more precisely getting involved in my life in a way show me that what I do actually matters to you what have you been up to today o karate what did you do did you learn something new see something like that just like making conversation out of something you know the last one number seven has to do with interest show that they're interested in me and me only now don't get me wrong I don't mind at all if guys talk to their friends and that being other girls too of course but I do have a problem with guys trying to make me jealous because if that happens I lose interest like this I got no time for that if I'm interested in you and you're interested in me it should be about us and not making each other jealous and all that stuff is just so childish I have a lot of people that I talk to on a regular basis and I don't want a guy that kind of stops me from doing that and I would never stop a guy from talking to their friends either like that's not something that I do I always trust a person until they show me that they can't be trusted so I walk around and trust people 100% at all times and that's just the way it is all right so if you fit all these criterias be sure to send an application to su and okay I'm just joking oh my god I'm actually very funny that was a joke by the way in case you need that in with a little teaspoon okay anyway I really hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did be sure to smash the like button also be sure to check out all my social media links that is listed down in description down below down in the description down below just to clarify this video was only made for entertainment purposes so please don't get offended by anything I said or did or whatever and yeah I hope to see you guys within a couple of days with a brand new video bye [Music]
