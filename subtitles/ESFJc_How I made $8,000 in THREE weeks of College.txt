 what's up guys it's Elliott here welcome back to another video today's video is a little bit different I just want to sit down and share story with you I try to really make my videos really good stories and a lot of times I used cinematics you know cool videography but those are just tools that I use to help better to tell the story and for today's story I don't really think I need any of that so yeah I'm really just gonna be sitting here and talking to you so if you want to go clean your room if you want to go do something else and leave this video running in the background feel free if you're new to the channel welcome I make videos about college entrepreneurship honestly all sorts of random stuff but today I'm talking about how I made over $8,000 over the past three weeks okay so in order to really explain what I was doing to make over $8,000 over the past three weeks I need to give you a quick backstory so way back when I was a high school student like two years ago I was flipping and reselling to make money on the side if you guys have never heard of flipping or reselling a lot of times people will be flipping and reselling like supreme or like streetwear but what I was doing was really random things like uno cards I buy camera gear I buy old computers and basically I just buy them local and then sell them online all my friends were working at like the mall or at a restaurant I actually worked at a restaurant for a little bit too but this was making such good money that I stopped working there and I was able to make a good amount as a high school student it's really not that hard you just kind of buy things that people are selling you get it for a low price and then sell it for higher I think I made something like over ten thousand dollars over the time that I was flipping and reselling and one week in college I actually made over a thousand two hundred dollars of profit off of just like a few items that I flipped I already made a video on this if you guys want to check it out I'll put it somewhere here but the issue with flipping and reselling is time you have to spend a ton of time online looking for products and then you have to actually go out and meet people and then you have to go list them online take photos and then you have to actually ship them out it's just the whole process and it takes up a lot of time and when I went off to college I didn't have a lot of time and I was trying to focus on classes not the best way to make money and so I ended up looking for some scalable ways to sell things online like I was with flipping and I came across this thing called Amazon FBA so amazon FBA is amazon fulfillment by Amazon and basically what it is is people will get products sell them on Amazon and Amazon will take care of the shipping the handling and the customer service basically everything dealing with the actual products and that's not an amazing to me because it sounded like it would save me a lot of time and I can basically just pay Amazon to do a lot of the dirty work now the business is a little bit different because you buy in both you have your own product you make it your own it's basically you're starting your own private label brand it sounded really interesting to me and I saw a lot of people making a lot of money from it so I decided to give it a shot my freshman year of college so with Amazon FBA you're gonna see a trend here but usually you're selling really random products because the popular products that everyone else sells it's usually pretty competitive so my first product ever my first attempt at Amazon FBA was with felt leather boards I'll try to find a photo of the actual products that I sold so I'll put it up right here but I ended up trying to sell these my freshman year and I feel I worked my ass off I didn't go to parties every time I finished my homework and finish up with class I would go to the library and just do research for the entire day and I still ended up losing around $2,000 which is a lot of money for a college student but I was super motivated and I learned a lot from that first failure so I decided to give it another shot this time I decided to sell TOEFL holders I know in a super super random and people always give me a weird look whenever I say it but those are the types of products that do well for Amazon FBA so I did all the hard stuff I found suppliers in China I had my manufacturers customized my product I did everything I needed to do and then had the products shipped over to the US and sent to the Amazon warehouses when my two thousand topple holders arrived at the Amazon warehouses that's when my first youtube video started to blow up and when I say the video blew up I mean I had a hundred subscribers and within the first few days I had a thousand views by the end of the week I had 10,000 and then by the end of the next week I had 20 and then 30 and then 40 and it wasn't stopping at that point in time I had to make a really important decision I was a college student at the time and my video was blow me up I could either choose to ride this wave on YouTube and see where it takes me or do the logical thing and work on the business because I've been working on it for two months three months now and my inventory it just arrived it was time for launch so I decided to really focus on the YouTube videos and I put aside my business I basically just left all 2000 of my tonfa holders at the Amazon warehouses and they were just stranded there I kind of forgot about them but not really you guys probably can't relate to this feeling but the burden of having $10,000 worth of TOEFL holders in warehouses across the country is just insane it was so stressful for me but I was really terrible at dealing with it I just kept on putting it off I was just making youtube videos I was like you know what I'll worry about this later when it's a bigger issue I just kept putting it off putting off putting it off I basically just assumed that all the money that I put into my business was lost and I was just making videos until I was about to get hit with massive fees from Amazon for keeping my inventory in their warehouses and when I say massive fees I'm talking like thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars in fees so it was about to get really really bad so I reached out to my friend Samer who sells full-time on Amazon and he basically set up some ads for me we lowered the price a ton to get rid of this inventory before I got hit with these fees so this is where it gets crazy the day after Samer sets up some campaigns for me and we have some ads running I get a few sales and I'm ecstatic because my taco holders are finally selling every single night I went to sleep I woke up and I had a few sales and then throughout the day I would get a notification saying a few sales had been made and so within the first week or so I had about 16 units sold by the second week things really picked up and I sold over two thousand dollars worth of the taco holders now you guys know where this is heading but by week three I sold over $8,000 worth of the taco holders and I was officially sold out but if you remember what I was saying I was doing anything I could to really get these products out of these Amazon warehouses because I didn't want to get hit with the feeds I lowered the price of ton on my products from my original sale price and although I did eight thousand dollars in sales over the past three weeks I actually ended up losing money I paid around five thousand seven hundred dollars for my inventory as well as shipping and at the end of the day Amazon is paying me only two thousand dollars and so I lost around four four thousand dollars on these taco holders by now you've realized that I didn't actually make eight thousand dollars I actually lost money and if you're here because you wanted a get-rich-quick strategy then I'm sorry but this video is not about that in fact I'll save you some time right now and tell you that there's no such thing as getting rich quick this video is definitely clickbait but I titled this video how I made eight thousand dollars in three weeks because I actually think the people who need to hear failure stories the most are people searching for a quick and easy way to make money a lot of people online are really not that transparent you know whether it be dropship being or Amazon FBA affiliate marketing whatever it may be it's really not that easy and a lot of times people try to make it seem easy now I do have friends out there who have found a lot of success through e-commerce and selling things online but I wanted to share my failures story because all I see nowadays are these success stories not a lot of failure stories and I do think it's important for people to realize that it is a very big risk to start a business and failure is a very real possibility if not a more probable outcome you know luckily YouTube worked out for me so I'm gonna be okay even though I lost a few thousand on my business but there are people who put everything on the line you know they put their entire life savings into these businesses and if they only hear about the success stories then they're not really gauging the risk appropriately and I just want people to have the whole picture in mind when they're making their decisions that's why I titled the video the way that I did because a lot of times you're just looking for success stories and it's important to have the whole picture in mind and it's important to understand that you have to make decisions based on the way that reality is not just the way that you want it to be so I'm turning down my business now it's a huge weight off my shoulders because now I don't have to worry about my 2,000 taco holders around the u.s. now they're in customers hands and happy about it so I'm feeling really good about that so before I wrap this video up I do want to share some of the lessons that I've learned from this experience I spent over four thousand dollars learning this experience because that's how much I lost on this business so might as well share with you guys so yeah I failed I lost thousands of dollars which is no small sum for me or any college student and you think that I'd regret it and you think that I'd be upset but honestly I don't regret it at all when I was getting started with my Amazon business I kind of thought about what was the worst case scenario and what was the best case scenario the worst case scenario was that I lost a few thousand which is no fun but I would at least learn something along the way and the best case scenario was that I learned something and I made a lot of money doing it basically I ended up pretty close to the worst case scenario where I just lost thousands of dollars but I learned something along the way and it's actually super crazy how it turned out the strategies that I use to get my product on Amazon onto the first page of Amazon I actually used for my videos to get it on the first page of YouTube so it's really not that bad it's actually helped a lot with what I do with YouTube and just helped me really understand business a little bit better anyways I learned a lot through this business but the biggest lesson that I learned is to always assume that everything is gonna go wrong I think there's something called like what Murphy I think Murphy's Law Murphy's Law states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong I don't really know the logic behind that I think it was in interstellar and this is super important lesson that I learned because I honestly was really naive I just thought that everything would go according to plan because because I just worked hard on it and that's just not true things go wrong things go south and so you should always be prepared for it you live and you learn and I learned a lot from this experience so I'm not upset about it at all but I wanted to share it with you guys because I thought it would be valuable I felt somewhat vulnerable filming this video you know we're talking about finances we're talking about my failures and this was a huge part of my life for a really long time in college and it's crazy to think like how a chapter has passed but revisiting this was like pretty interesting so I hope you guys enjoyed the video again this is kind of just like me sitting down and talking I was thinking of like making a video where I just cook and talk okay so that there's like some storyline where I start a meal and then finish it but okay yeah I don't know if that makes sense so let me know if you guys have any ideas you know what to call this I do enjoy just sitting down and talking with you guys I also planned a lot for this video but again I just want to turn the camera on talk to you guys and hear you guys feedback so let me know if you guys enjoyed this video drop a like on it and if you're new to the channel please subscribe I
