 hey I just wanted to talk about this this inherent problem in Christianity that exists because it's it's pretty counterproductive to what they want to do at least genetically anyways if you had a crop you'd want to take the best of the crop and and every next crop you'd want to keep using the best seats the seeds from the best plant Christianity sort of doing the opposite and they're going to pretty much destroy their gene pool by doing this a this and basically they're trying to preach chastity and restraint from sexual sexual drives and such but what they're doing is they're taking their most chaste their most sexually pure right the ones that have the most self restraint and they're putting them in the clergy and they can't pass on their seed they can't have kids so what's the gene pool left with right and this has been happening for thousands of years now two thousand years almost what do you think happens you take all of your most sexually pure and the next clergy has to come from whoever can't can't be in the clergy right and so what you're going to end up doing is you're going to end up demoralizing your your gene pool you're going to take people that are have very strong sexual urges and that's going to be the basis of your gene pool and you're going to take these people with strong sexual urges throw them into the clergy and say hey don't have sex and here are these people in the clergy with very strong sexual urges and they can't have no way to release it and so what's going to happen well we've already started seeing it molesting children and I don't know it's nice nuts no it's not really intelligent to base a your your law structure around degrading your gene pool away from your values I mean if you wanted to do something in the opposite direction it might be better to uphold your values i mean take force the clergy members to have children and the ones that are the most holy and able to have sexual straight force them and then all the ones who can't restrain themselves make them have abortions I mean that's the most which you're not allowing them to do so I mean I wouldn't be surprised about this this over over sexual gene pool that that you're trying to create here I mean this is only 2,000 years if you want your your religion to stay for another two thousand ten thousand years how long are you going to try to keep it around so what's your gene pool getting up like I mean you're just going to keep degrading it and degrading it until you just fall apart so something to think about
