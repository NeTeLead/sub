 hey guys welcome back to how to Switzerland Sarah here today just a casual cellphone video filming on the floor of my living room because I just want this to be a relaxed little story time about going to the doctor in Switzerland. [Music]. so I really wanted to film this because I actually went to the doctor's office three times this week which is something that I do not typically do in Switzerland I guess since I've been living in Switzerland on and off and going to school here and that kind of stuff I always put off anything medical until I was back in the US so usually like dental appointments doctor appointments I would tend to do it while I'm on vacation in the US or things like that but yeah this past week I was really sick and not getting better after you know many many days probably after about 14 days I was not feeling good so I said okay we really have to go to the doctor and see what is going on in case I need like you know to get something taking care of that serious or whatever so finally I decided to go to the doctor I do not like going to the doctor at all I can just say that I do have a lot of anxiety around going to anything medical and I also have a massive phobia of anything like about needles and blood and that kind of stuff so I tend to avoid it at all costs and I know it's especially scary to go to the doctor in a foreign country and I know a lot of you watching are in the process of moving to Switzerland or you're interested in moving to Switzerland so more than likely at some point you're gonna need to go to the doctor and I know it can be you know like I said it's a little intimidating and scary cuz you're in like a foreign place it's not what you're used to and you don't know what to expect so hopefully with this video I can um walk you through what happened to me so maybe it gives you a better idea of what might happen when you go to the doctor okay so like I said I went to the doctor three times this week so I'll try to talk you through each of those appointments so the first appointment was my first time ever at this doctor so I'm considered a new patient so there's a little bit more involved in that first appointment so basically we walk into the office it's what's called like a group practice like because of the type of insurance that we have I think it's called like HMO we have to go to this specific doctor's office we can't go to any doctor that we want based on our insurance you can choose plans like that where you can go anywhere but they're more expensive so we went to this practice and walk and the guy at the reception just asked for our insurance information and that was it really he just asked for that and here in Switzerland the insurance cards have like the tip on them similar to like your debit card it looks exactly the same like the chip on your debit card you have those on health insurance cards here in the US we didn't ever have anything like like that on our health insurance cards it was just like a piece of plastic with your policy and your name and stuff but here there's like you know a chip on it so obviously they can scan that and get whatever data that they need so he just looks at the card scan that quickly and we sat down I was kind of surprised that they didn't give me a clipboard to fill out I feel like if you go to the doctor in the US they always give you like a clipboard where you have to like fill out your medical history and like all that kind of stuff and I didn't get anything they're just like okay we have the insurance you know you can wait in the waiting room so we waited for awhile in the waiting room there were actually a good amount of people there and one thing that I noticed in Switzerland so the waiting room was actually a closed glass room like it had a door on it and there were quite a lot of people in there and every time some of you would come in like they would greet everybody which was kind of strange to me so somebody would walk in and be like could you see and everyone would be like hallo could see though like that like everyone was greeting each other whenever somebody went and or sometimes when people left they would even say like goodbye and stuff so it was kind of different interaction I guess people were really kind of engaging with each other and that did happen every time I went so I guess that's kind of a cultural norm here to greet the people sitting in the waiting room with you and I guess since it's like a closed room it feels a little bit more normal to do that so we waited and then I got called to go in so in the u.s. how it normally worked is if you're waiting in a waiting room a nurse or like an assistant of some sort will come out and be like Sarah and then you know you walk back you get put in the empty room they might check a few things the nurse or the assistant and then usually you wait in the room for quite a while for the doctor that's my experience going to the doctor and here was not like that at all so actually I was just waiting in the waiting room and first of all they don't call you by your first name here like I think in the US they always said Sarah but here they said found nor spit out Knorr so they called me by my last name and then like they shook my hand and that was actually the doctor so the actual doctor she came and got me from the waiting room and took me directly to her office so there's no waiting like she just came and got me when she was ready I guess and then I went in her office and I wish I had a picture um I didn't really want to take pictures of that but you know whatever obviously but it was very different than like in the u.s. I found that they're usually very small rooms typically no window and usually you sit on a like a bed that's covered in paper but here the room was very large it had a ton of windows obviously that's a huge plus and there was like a bed that you lay on but like there was no paper or plastic or anything on it so I figured I'm supposed to sit in the chairs because over to the other side of the room there was like a big desk with on like three chairs on one side and then one chair obviously for the doctor and like a computer and all that kind of stuff so she brought me in and then like we sat down at her desk it felt kind of like you know when you go to the bank and you're like sitting it like with somebody telling them information and they're typing it in it was similar to that because we sat down and then that's where she actually asked me about my medical history so the doctor was actually the one asking allergies like have you had this have you had that do you have a family history of this on the things that I'm used to filling out like on a form she just asked me everything and was typing it in as we went along so we basically answered all those questions got that out of the way and then she said okay so what brings you in today and I told her you know I was having really severe ear and throat pain for two weeks that wasn't going away and then she said okay like let's take a look so she pulled you know paper over like the the bed thing and I went in sat on there and she just looked in my ears and a my throat and all that kind of stuff and she could see that it was infected but yeah I'm not a medical person but when you have infections they can either be viral bacterial and viral infections there's nothing you can do to really make it go away faster in terms of medicine and that kind of stuff but if it is bacterial that's when you need antibiotics and she was unable to tell which is normal it's difficult to tell the difference between a viral and a bacterial infection she said like based on what you described and what I see I think it's viral but it might be bacterial but the only way I can determine if it's bacterial is by giving you a blood test and I did not want to do that I thought I thought that was a bit strange as well because in the u.s. I've had this kind of stuff many times and I've never had to give blood in order to get diagnosed and she said the reason is she really does not want to give antibiotics if she's not a hundred percent sure you know that I need it and she can tell you know if it's bacterial and if it requires antibiotics through the blood so we said you know and then she said but basically if you don't want to give blood that's totally fine I don't think it's bacterial but you know take a if you profligate some rest and if you don't feel good in like three or four days come back in and we'll see if we can figure it out another way so that was about it for the first visit I think so I could definitely tell that here they're a lot just from that first visit they're a lot more like conservative in how they like prescribe medicine they seem very hesitant to give you anything like prescription grade like she did give me medicine but it was all like stuff you can buy over-the-counter and yeah they were super conservative about prescribing antibiotics whereas in the u.s. I've been prescribed antibiotics over the phone you know you can like call your doctor like I don't feel good I have like a sore throat and the doctor will just like call in a prescription for a lot of different things just over the phone obviously the u.s. is a lot looser about pills and you know medicine and that kind of stuff and then there you go three four days went by and I was still feeling horrible I was feeling about the same okay so for the next appointment it was a Saturday and we went and they were only open for like four hours on a Saturday but we managed to get in but I'm super grateful that they were open is I was quite surprised that there on a Saturday given just the opening hours of things in Switzerland and this time we walk in and since they have our insurance and all that you I basically just said my name and they said sit in the waiting room so I sat in the waiting room and this time the lady that came and got me from the waiting room she worked in like the lab you know where you give blood and that kind of stuff so the lady got me and took me directly into the lab and the same lady who I get lightheaded just talking about it I hate this kind of stuff but the same lady that pulled me from the waiting room actually on took my blood so they could test for bacterial infection so they did that that was actually really quick they did run it and luckily they found that there was no signs of a bacterial infection in my blood so yeah they did the blood test and now I'm sitting in the lab waiting in the lab and now the doctor comes to the lab and gets me from the lab to take me to her office so again I didn't have to get put in a room and wait the doctor came and got me directly and took me into the office and you know we addressed everything she went over the results of the of the blood work she gave further recommendations and she said yeah there's like some issue in my ear and I should come back and get that's the worded out as well and she gave me more medicine and stuff and that was basically it she was super super knowledgeable and friendly by the way I should say it kind of goes without saying but they also extremely good English I never like force people to speak English like if they want to speak German that's totally totally fine but it seems like they prefer to if they can tell that you are American I did have Matthias with me as well though of course sometimes the doctor might be looking for a word that they might not know right off the top of their head in English so yeah that was basically it so yeah the blood sample was negative so I didn't need antibiotics and she gave me a different medication like over-the-counter again over-the-counter type of thing and said come back in like two days and we're gonna like clean out your ear and we're gonna like look at something else in your ear to see if there's like something else going on there or whatever and then for the third appointment which was actually this morning instead of trying to film this while this is fresh in my head went and said my name sat down though the same lady who got me from the waiting room is the one who took care of my ear and then that was it the doctor came into the room where I was and she talked me through everything and said things are looking better and whatever so I think that's it I don't know if this is helpful at all I'm just trying to describe you know kind of what happened so you can know a little bit more what to expect and actually some things that are slightly different I feel like the doctors here like do a lot more I feel like in the u.s. you always had like nurses and like lab people and assistants and stuff and the doctor would really just come in for like five minutes and look at you and be out really really fast whereas here I mean the doctor I had today she was drawn I'm not kidding she was drawing me diagrams of like ears and all the tubes and like you know really making sure that I understand the problem and she spent a long time with me explaining how I can prevent things like this in the future and stuff and she was extremely extremely helpful and like just carrying and it felt a lot different going to the doctor here yeah it was just a little bit more like it didn't feel as rush do you know what I mean which was really nice and also the doctors here were all in like uniforms like some sort of scrubs or something whereas I feel like in the u.s. they were normally in like were they always like just like a tie like if it was a guy I feel like he was usually just in like a like a nice outfit like business casual whereas here of course if you're in a hospital in the states they all have like scrubs on and stuff but I'm talking if you just go to like a general doctor like I did I feel like it was usually they were doctors usually not in uniform but here they were so yeah and then the last thing that's obviously interesting which I'm gonna have to make a second video is the billing so I'm gonna be honest I have no idea how much all of this is going to cost as an American the first thing that I think is like why do I keep going back this is gonna be so expensive I don't want to go three times like this is this gonna cost me like a thousand dollars like how much is it's gonna cost and basically we don't know like I asked about this is our first time using our Swiss insurance and we asked like do we have to pay anything upfront cuz again in the US and my experience you pay like this copay right when you go to the doctor like twenty to thirty dollars you pay that upfront and then of course things get worked out with your insurance or whatever but when we went we didn't have to pay anything all three times we didn't have to pay anything they just said we are gonna build your insurance and then you will get they said like a copy so I don't know if the copy is gonna have a bill attached to it or not I tried to look in my insurance policy to find details about if we have a copay or if we just have to pay everything until we meet our deductible what's included and I couldn't really find anything I should look a little bit deeper but I figured I'll just wait a week or two until we get the bill and see what happens and then I can even go over it with you guys how much all of this costs because yeah I mean health care in Switzerland it's not socialized it's not free it's it you know it can get expensive not us expensive but yeah we'll see how much it costs for these doctor's appointments I think that's it I have some notes here but yeah overall I had a great experience given everything given my anxiety around going to the doctor and stuff I feel like they were very accommodating to me and yeah that's it anything to add matthias did I miss anything I cover it okay alright I hope you found this helpful or interesting in some way you guys if you liked it if you like these casual videos let me know in the
