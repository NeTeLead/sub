 [Music]. so when you envision yourself when you envision yourself working as a programmer for a big corporation it's going to things are going to move slow there's a lot of documentation you have to do there's Sox rules sarbanes-oxley you have to follow rules you have to write documents you have to you'll have a project manager and he'll tell you we need this document in this document you need to test it you need to test this before it goes into production they actually use it there's a lot of stuff okay so my point is learning programming this is a big point I wanted to make learning programming is actually kind of easy learning a programming language it's kind of easy if you learn how to make a webpage and how to save data and how to do logic and then save it to a database and write reports if you learn how to do that that's great you know how to code the problem is every company you go to has a different problem so your biggest challenge it's not learning how to code it's figuring out what they want you to code so it's always very strange when I go into an interview they ask me so many technical questions can you do this do you remember that I sit there and think yeah I know that I can google that right my question is what is that you want me to do how bad is your code is your code good or is it bad one of the biggest problems I've had in my entire career or is bad code I've walked into some places especially as a contractor and they said here fix this guess what it was a nightmare the code was thousands of lines they they didn't plan it out some bad programmer or programmers who aren't there anymore they coded and coded in code and they made a function I saw a function once that was 2,500 lines long to get to the middle of it I had to scroll in scroll and they said change something in the middle of that that's when programming sucks when you have to deal with someone else's bad code and you have a deadline to do it that's why when you interview for a job you they aren't interviewing me when I interview for a job they think they're interviewing me but I'm actually interviewing them I'm figuring out do I want to work for you because I'll tell you right now as a programmer especially with experience I get emails every single day asking me if I want to go work somewhere else I get maybe one to three to five emails a day I get tons of emails but but I'm at a good place right now and I like where I'm at it's ten times better than anywhere I've ever been so I ignore those emails I don't care I only pay attention to those emails if I was upset about something or if I saw the future was gonna be bad so my point is if you become good and experienced people will be knocking down your door to get you it sounds great but that doesn't necessarily mean going somewhere else is a good thing I've left jobs that were bad and jumped into jobs that were worse worse I'm like oh man I thought I had it bad now I've got a real bad and it's all based on who your manager is how the managers management style is how difficult is the code to fix what kind of architecture do they have how many tables you could walk into place that has ten tables that's easy to understand or 5,000 tables that's impossible to understand that's why you need to ask questions in your interviews and I know it's really difficult to actually find out anything in an interview because you really when you start asking them questions they don't really talk about it they're like well I don't know what kind of main princess you know they don't they don't know where they don't tell you anything so you you end up interviewing but not here's another thing when you're interviewing here's a tip I hate I'm sorry that this is so random because I could go on forever about this but when you're interviewing the feeling you get about those people that's the you're right about that feeling so if you're interviewing in one guy's a jerk and you know oh he's the Manager guess what you're right he we'll be a jerk you got that feeling you get about that guy is usually on target every time I've been hired for a job I'm like man everyone's nice that one guy seemed kind of kind of harsh though guess what he's he was harsh all the time your intuition was right not saying that you shouldn't take the job or anything but your intuition is probably right so it interviews to me are usually done pretty poorly like I said they ask you a bunch of technical questions and the reality is my technical stuff is good like I said learning programming is not hard it's applying it in fixing your code that may be impossible you know you may be replacing somebody that quit because they were angry right why did they quit why why are you why did you come into that company why do they need you so bad that's something you need to know are you filling a job position the money is good if you find a good company here's the good news the money is good you deuced it does seem to max out at a certain amount when you get into them if you're in the Midwest and you have a good stable job and you're in the 80,000 90,000 100,000 range if you're in that range you're not probably gonna make a whole lot more than that because it just that's just the max because they're not gonna pay more than hundred and ten hundred twenty thousand in the Midwest I'm not talking about Silicon Valley New York all that stuff in the Midwest you're gonna max out about in that close to a hundred thousand as it as an experienced program I started out at 30,000 and my first my first raise was like 4% and I got 33,000 and then after a year and a half I quit and moved to Chicago from Tulsa and I went up to like 50,000 and then my next job was like 65,000 that's how I moved within two or three years I started out got a little experience quit and moved quit and moved and then I became a contractor consultant and then I made over a hundred thousand for a long time. high-pressure working in Chicago was very difficult I was a consultant so they would send me across the city all the time and so I was in lots of traffic very stressful some of the people there weren't so nice you know some of the managers weren't so nice so you you will get paid but you also pay for stress anyway that's just an opener I wanted to get that out there there's a million more things I could tell you and I'm going to add them to more videos but I just wanted to get this out there this is intro to programming this is what my experience has been like it's it's been it's paid off very well I mean I've been doing this for 15 years so if it sounds like I'm trying to discourage you I'm trying to just tell you what the reality is I'm not trying to discourage you I'm telling you you can make a living at it it can be good but you have to learn how to deal with stress learn how to deal with problems you cannot let one little problem get you because I T is nothing but problems every day something's breaks every day something breaks everything every day constantly you're fixing problems that's what you do you're fixing problems fixing you're just fixing and fixing and fixing and you can't take it personally you know at first I would get so and when I was in college I would get so angry like when I get a problem I would get so mad like man I can't do this then I realize wait a minute this is how it's gonna be all right I'm out I'll tell you more later. you
