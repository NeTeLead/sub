 I saw a post on Reddit the other day which asked why don't you like John fish it's kind of like when you hear two people talking about you and they don't know that you can hear them and so even though you know that that conversation isn't meant for your ears you listen in anyways because you have some sort of morbid curiosity except instead of two people in this case it was hundreds so of course like any reasonable person I clicked it and I got to read about why a bunch of people didn't like me and then as I kind of dove into it more I realized it wasn't just one post but there were multiple posts all that a bunch of people just talking about why they didn't like me I can't say that I've ever experienced anything like that before a lot of the comments said that I was arrogant pretentious superficial but pseudoscientist wasn't that smart I mean you get the picture I think the criticism has validity to it I mean ever since I started on YouTube I've struggled with the question of identity I've never felt like I fit into any of the typical creator molds and as a result of the started with this identity I've definitely made some mistakes I've made some videos and I've been you know experimenting with being a person that today I'm not proud I've come to realize that I'm not an entertainer I'm not that funny I talked kind of awkwardly I'm not that attractive I'm not you know genius-level smart I'm not a Hollywood level filmmaker I'm not a crazy entrepreneur I'm just me as a result I don't really fit into any of these molds of creators I post videos because I'm just trying to figure out who I am and who I want to be and I know that some people benefit from following along in that process on that journey I love the creative process I love making things but posting things I wouldn't do it unless I thought that some people would get some benefit from it and if people didn't get benefit from it that I wouldn't post so when I read criticism of me I mean people calling me arrogant superficial it scares me a little bit because I see people judging me in the system that I don't want to belong to I don't want my identity to be a college youtuber or an influencer or a pseudo academic or or anything like that I mean people who accept those labels kind of box themselves in to have to have the appearance of being entertainers being gorgeous you know super-smart whatever I'm not that I don't want to do that I am John fish I'm me I like myself I mean I get a be my own best friend and yeah I have no idea who I want to be in the future what I want to do I mean you gotta realize I'm only 19 like everything is up in the air my identity as a teenager is so ill-defined that of course people are gonna think that it's arrogant when I post videos talking about habits I'm trying out or lessons that I've learned or thoughts that I've been having I'm not really an authority on anything what I am is a curious person who just got really lucky in life I mean that's it that's me and now I'm just trying to do my best to do my best if I don't fit the mold of you know a fun ironic College youtuber it's because I'm not one you know if I don't fit the mold of a super genius making novel discoveries it's because I'm not one I mean if I don't fit the mold of a self-help guru who has an answer for every question it's because I'm not one I'm a 19 year old trying to figure out who I am who I want to be and to be honest I don't have a lot figured out I have tried a lot of things and I've failed that a lot of things and I will continue to try a lot of things and I anticipate that I will fail at most of those things when I think about the past 12 months how many different faces I've tried on how many different types of videos I've made kind of different phases of my life I've gone through I mean it's crazy I've changed a ton there have been really good experiences and really bad experiences but no matter what all of those experiences have shaped me they've helped me to mature to grow up and everything I experienced now good or bad continues to do the same so yeah I've been arrogant I've been superficial I've been pseudo-scientific I mean all of that hate it's true made a ton of mistakes also help people in genuine with my struggles and I've made some pretty cool videos and I promise that I'm gonna continue to do both the good and the bad because I'm a human and I'm a teenager and that's what we did but we also grow up and as I've changed over the years I think it's mostly been for the better and I still have a long ways to go like a really long ways to go but I'm starting to learn that it's not really about the end point because I doubt I'll ever be in a place where I'm fully happy with who I am or where everyone is fully happy with with who I am that's just not feasible what I'm starting to learn is that it's about the journey the journey counts and that's why I'm making these videos is so fun because I'm able to kind of figure out where on that journey I am and where I need to go from here and sure sometimes I'm gonna make mistakes hopefully I can correct them and move forward I've confidence it's all gonna work out in the end so that's me and if you want to follow along by subscribing and see where I end up go for it I really appreciate it if you don't no worries I'm John fish thanks for watching this video and I'll see you again soon
