 [Music]. [Music] so I got a one wheel last week so I could do dolly shots kind of go left with my camera go right forward and backwards and I ended up pushing my center of gravity too far forward I literally did a Superman like this because I was dumb I was like oh you just lean forward and that caused the front of the one wheel to touch the ground and I launched forward and I took a couple running steps put my hands out and I just did the asphalt slip-and-slide I didn't break anything and that was my number one concern the number one thing that people do when they fall is to put an arm out they they try to catch themselves so I decided to just do the whole Superman asphalt slip-and-slide so I did have a helmet on when I crashed I just didn't have gloves on so I ended up getting all my palms tore up my whole arm here on the inside and the outside the whole side of my body here I got some cool scars here on my chest I'm gonna have lost like some cool story to tell to make up some that actually sounds as cool as the scars look I guess my knee is a little compressed I've been putting cold ice on it it's been fine I'm okay it's a few days now everything's starting to heal up take good care and oh no infection anything like that I'm all good you know what YouTube I'm just gonna I'm just gonna own it sometimes I read from script so right after that happened I just rushed inside because I don't want anyone to call an ambulance I don't have to deal with any of that I don't have to like reject their care and like no I'm good I promise we'll just let us check you and then as soon as you say okay boom 4,000 dollar medical bill like so I was I was good and all these thoughts are rushing there my brain about I have a lot to get done and I don't really have hands right now and you don't really appreciate your hands until you can't even open a jar of pickles so I started talking about how I need to make a video but I can't because I'm in pain I don't feel that great and I'm definitely not motivated to do it but that got me thinking about motivation and doing things when I don't feel like it even today even though I'm I'm healed somewhat I guess I don't necessarily feel like walking around and creating this video that's what I wanted to talk about today motivation and how stay motivated to code or anything else you want to apply these tips to I know wait hold on wait don't don't click off the video wait wait wait wait I promise there's like some actionable stuff in here that you can do it's not just another Tony Robbins thing or you know one of those videos where you're like alright I feel great I'm gonna try to actually give you some things that you could walk away with you're gonna be a you're gonna be a big fluff and we're both in focus two things in focus I can barely get in focus sometimes look a little buff there Josh so this is what I would say kind of like how motivation is for all of us including me it's kind of like the dichotomy of motivation we'll go watch a YouTube video we'll get motivated well think about all the cool things we could have if we do that thing that we're motivated about doing well do the thing for five minutes. or we'll do it for a while and we'll get bored and then finally we'll actively avoid doing whatever it is we know we should be doing or that will benefit us if we do it procrastination the land of tomorrow or next Monday or next month or next New Year's resolution where most of our potential lives I would say in the land of tomorrow procrastination Vil so it's gone for now can't even lift weights anymore goodbye muscles so what we need to do is realize that it's actually backwards so you do the thing you get inspired while you're like oh wow I actually I actually am I took that first step and then you get motivated it's like when you go to the gym most of the days when I go to the gym I have when I have like the biggest gains or the best workouts it's always the times where I'm like I really don't want to go and then I get there I'm like you know after the warm-up or whatever I'm like oh man I'm really glad I came that's how it is that's how it is for all of us so I get it it's backwards it's unintuitive but that's just that's how it works how do you get yourself to take that first initial step if the key to being motivated is to just do the thing that's easier to say Josh like so I'll tell you guys how I do it there's three words state story and strategy those are the questions that they're not just words they're actually questions so what is my state how am I feeling about things what is my story what am i telling myself like how I'm feeling like today sucks or tastes great or I'm so awesome I'm so I'm so excited that I get to go to this thing what is my story what am I telling myself based on how I feel in my low energy and my high energy am I pretty neutral and then what is my strategy based on those two prior ones is gonna determine what I actually do how I actually execute so the way I alter my state how I'm feeling about things my emotional state I get is kind of a little woowoo out there just bear with me here I have weird rituals we all have weird rituals we all have our little nervous things that we do what a little nervous habits or things that we do to calm ourselves down to get in the headspace of doing a live stream I'll go outside in my backyard and I'll play with my dogs for like 10 or 15 minutes it's a good way to up the energy I'll do some push-ups and it's great for engagement I'm already you know and engage with my dogs having fun just kind of if I want to get into like focused and study mode so this would be like for code I turn on a movie soundtrack I'm a big movie soundtrack buff I loved Hans Zimmer specially man his stuff is so good have you ever turned like I mean it makes anything epic like you could just be like shredding paper you just put on like Hans Zimmer background and now you're its most epic paper shred of your life anyways I I do meditate I don't talk about it that much because again people start to think you're like oh you're into that stuff like because I'm like that too right I just do it to slow down kind of just take a pulse on everything up here like how am i how am i doing I'm my feeling is there any perpetual repeating kind of thoughts that I need to pinpoint and be like alright address it do a little body scan you know just like have you ever tried to feel your hair I know it sounds really 4:20 but like takes a second and it requires a lot of awareness and that will kind of like slow you down and do that for the rest of your body for the gym I set out my supplements on the counter I take them in the order that I put them out every single day same order same supplements and then I go and I listen to an audiobook and then I get in my car and I roll down my windows and I sit there for a few seconds and it's just like a ritual that's what I do to go to the gym and that kind of hypes me up and gets me prepared you're more likely to get started with something if you have like a pleasant ritual to get it done actually the dopamine receptors in your brain fire before you actually get the reward I know that's really weird but the dopamine receptors in your brain actually start going off when you're about to get the reward and when you get it it's nowhere near the kind of activity as like right before so if there's something difficult that I need to do I'm not a fan of or that I just know I have to take care of I set up a little routine that angles it in a positive light and then that usually moves into the next activity so for creativity for me I have my best shower thoughts when I'm just driving. whatever reason me driving gives me the most influential kind of ideas that I've ever had in my life [Music] my idea to start crying real was me crossing over train tracks I was like holy crap I can make this a thing and I can do this and like every big idea that I've ever had was when I was just out driving out for a walk walking my dogs or listening to audiobooks and for whatever reason it's not I don't only have shower thoughts and a shower too much I mean I have like pretend arguments with people that like you know like that never happened like you know like I think we all do that too this is not a very good shot but welcome to my bedroom you can see all of my antiseptic stuff where I died basically want to try to sleep one thing I want to mention here is that there can be external or situational motivators in life or even d motivators so what happens a lot is when you try to better yourself and you tell other people what you're trying to do you tell people about your ambitions one of two things isn't gonna happen you're either gonna get support or they're gonna say that you're crazy if you tell someone that doesn't have the same ambition as you even if it's your friend even if it's your mom or your dad or family friends what you're basically doing by telling someone your ambitions or goals depending on how well they know you like they'll call you out on it be like what you've never done anything you're saying hey take a good look because I'm about to do a whole lot more do they want more for their life or are they content can they live vicariously through you if they can great then they should be happy for you and they should support you but I think what happens more often than not is that when you try to do better get in better circumstances in life a lot of people will try and bring you back down it's this thing that I think about like a crabs in a bucket mentality so as soon as one of the crabs is almost out of the bug everyone just like pulls it back down with all like no no you can't it's possible that action like you taking action inspires action but I would say more often than not it inspires jealousy you just have to be aware that it's gonna happen when you start doing these things and when you start telling people your plans and goals and visions that you have and things that you want to create it's really easy to get jealous when your friends are making progress in something when your friends are graduating from college when your friends are getting jobs and your friends are getting married having kids are doing all those things and you or not it's really easy to get jealous rather than just be happy for them and support them it's almost like an unintended insult for them it's a lot easier to try and bring people back down like the crabs in the bucket analogy then to build them up and support them and say yeah you got this I don't know why that is it shouldn't be that way but for whatever reason it's just a lot easier to be hater than a supporter it's your job to take the vision that you have in your head for whatever it is that you need to be motivated to do and take that out put it on paper and show the world because people can't see the divisions and stuff that you have in your head it's like that little Harry Potter wand where they put it in a little put in the little pool and then you can like see the memory except I think like like the vision in your head and like the goals and stuff like that's your job your job is to take this and make it physical tangible results as jaco willing would say freedom through discipline we all do things that we don't necessarily want to do all the time and even if you do the routine there's a little ritual you'll get to the N you still might be like I don't want to do this that's fine but you just have to do it don't don't take the break to remember the three words state story and strategy well how are you feeling what's what's going on in your mind right your emotional state your energy level and then what story you're telling yourself you having a good day you have a bad day are you gonna have a good rest of the night are you excited for something and then your strategy so change your state and the others will fall into place and to change your state make these little routines and that's that's how you do it it's maybe not what you wanted to hear but I think it's actionable and I gave you some examples of the things that I do and they're kind of weird but you know this is actually my little meditation chair here I sit here every morning when I wake up and I listen to this little guided meditation that's like. [Music]. feel your hair one other thing here since YouTube won't give me a friggin drawing button that people can join the channel and support the channel I made my own on my website and I can control everything there no one takes % so that's kind of nice I guess and benefit of being a program right I guess but I made my own and so you can go to my website and you can support me there if you would like to join the channel I can't give you emotes in the livestream which is what YouTube gives you but what I can give you are like like loyalty points in the store if you subscribe for two months you get any product you want in the store for free or any course you want and like I can just do a whole bunch more it's a lot more flexible there so if you want to support the channel support me and my dad and what we're doing here you know go check it out it's just grind real supporter so if you're interested there's links for different types of supporter tears we got like $10 $15 $20 and different rewards for each one so if you're interested check that out link for that is down there in the description seems like I'm begging but like it's a lot of money to do this and help my dad and help you guys and stay afloat sorry for ranting I appreciate you guys as my hands signing off I'll see you guys in the next [Music]
