 hello there and welcome have a seat and let's have a little conversation so I've called you here today to express to you why you should be proud that you're an ISTJ or why people who don't know is DJs should probably try to get to know some is tjs so let's first talk about what is an ISTJ you could look at the letter s' introverted sensing thinking judging that doesn't really mean much what really matters is what's going on in your mind in your brain so an is TJ has introverted sensing extraverted thinking introverted feeling and extroverted judging so contrary to what many people believe an honest TJ might actually be more in touch with their emotions than a lot of people and you know you might not talk about it that's fine you don't need to talk about it but you're aware of them but anyway we're not here to talk about your emotions we're here to talk about why you should be proud of yourself first of all you lead with introverted sensing and this is a skill that a lot of us do not have you have the ability to organize all of your past experiences and things that you've read about and ideas that you've come across and you kind of organize them and collect them and prioritize them you're pretty good at recognizing when a current experience is like a past experience and what's really great about that is if you're in a situation like one that you've been in the past where something bad happened you're more likely to have a little skepticism towards that situation you're like hey I've seen these things before this feels like it's gonna go down a pretty negative path if I follow through with this and that's a really great skill because a lot of people don't have that ability a lot of people will go through a situation that's exactly like one that they've been through before they didn't learn from that situation in the past they're doing the exact same thing that they did before they haven't learned you is tjs you learn not always there's exceptions to the rules but you are the most likely of all types to learn from a past experience UN is fj's and I'll talk about ash is fj's later so you're also good at routine does that mean that everything in your life is a routine no that's a huge misconception is DJs do not have everything as a routine but what's really cool is that you can create routines relatively easily you if you find a routine or a way of doing something that works you're gonna stick to it and you're gonna keep doing it and yeah you'll improve it here and there as needed but you'll you'll stick to that routine pretty well and you'll see the benefit of sticking to that routine it kind of goes along with those past experiences you see things that have happened in the past that work and therefore you recreate them so that they continue to work that's a very awesome skill that again a lot of people don't have I embedded that I'm really bad at finding a routine and sticking to it I could have a routine for like a day or a week and then I'll get over it and move on and never do it again so it's not really a routine as that so you guys are really great at that kind of thing like I said you're not gonna have everything in your life be a routine but the routines that you have you're gonna be pretty darn good at and there's gonna be a purpose for them there's gonna be a reason for them and that's because you have in your third slot introverted feeling an introverted feeling is kind of like an intuition about why you want something or why something matters maybe there isn't like a super logical reason or whatever maybe there is but you know what you want and why you want it so your second function is really cool so you have extroverted thinking as your can't function and what this helps you to do is to not only with your introverted sensing create a routine but you're gonna make that routine as efficient as possible you're gonna waste the least amount of energy possible I know a lot of is tjs and one of my cool friends at work he's an is TJ and he is really great at finding ways to work less not that he is doing less work he's not putting in as much effort he's really good at finding ways to put in less effort and still get the same kind of outcome and I think that's why is TJ's often end up in a position where they are doing the same thing over and over because you're good at it you're fast at it and you're repeating it so you're you're dependable you can repeat a task and you're also efficient with your time and energy what people tend to think about that from an outside perspective is that you're boring which I have not met a single boring is TJ out there ever I have not and another thing is people think that because you're an IAS TJ you never talk huh that's also a laugh I have had some insane conversations and loud conversations and interesting conversations with is TJ's because that past experience really gives you a good understanding of life like you really understand your own life you understand the patterns and if you're interested in history in the past of humanity you can also recognize those kind of patterns too and because you have fourths lot extra and intuition that means you can see the connections between them and make a new connections pretty easily but you're not going to do that all the time because you think it's pretty much a waste of time to constantly look for new connections when you can clearly see the past patterns you can clearly see what's replicable and what's not and and you can't have these really profound things to talk about but you might think that it's a little bit of a waste of time sometimes it takes away your energy from doing other things but that extraverted intuition that you have in the fourth slot means that those ideas that you think about they're even more profound than someone like me who thinks about those kind of things constantly and can't even create a routine for themselves you have these these thoughts about these connections about what's happened and what could happen and you don't focus your energy on them you just let them come you might talk about them you might just store them away along with your other memories and bring them up when it's relevant and that's really a great skill to it means that you can be really present in the moment but also you can be really interesting and think about things in the future and see potential outcomes for the future you are you more likely to not believe these ideas yeah because you've seen things happen in the past and you know how it's happened in the past and you're not gonna be fooled and that's another great thing about is tjs you're not often fooled people have a hard time fooling you because if you know them if you've seen them you've already stored your memories about them and if they start doing something that looks like something they've done in the past you're gonna recognize and see probably what's gonna happen so why should you be proud to be an ISTJ because you're just darn awesome and the world needs more of you to come out and say hey I'm here I'm cool I would love to I would love to watch about an IAS DJ I think is TJ's should make more YouTube channels about personality and about you know delving into themselves but you know I also know how that could kind of seem pointless ie my entire channel might just be pointless but I think it would be really interesting and I think people could learn a lot because is tjs people have some serious misconceptions about you guys like serious boring I have not met a boring is CJ like too stuck in their ways no you might be pretty good at doing things in a certain way but you are you perfectly permanently stuck in your ways no a 100% organized um no I've seen plenty of is CJ's who are not perfectly or organized and that's a huge misconception but you might be organized it might be useful for you to be organized but you also might not be it's okay you don't have to be organized and I've seen plenty of is DJ's who are just not organized and that's okay you're breaking the stereotypes cuz people don't know what they're talking about one may have these stereotypes about ICJ's but anyway that's all I really wanted to say I think that you as an ISTJ should be proud and you're a pretty freakin awesome person I just love the way your brain works and I'd love to learn more I'd love to observe you guys more because you are awesome I mean I'm a little biased because we're like pretty much the same I don't know if you guys know much about myers-briggs you is tjs that are watching but if you don't I'm an ENFP and I'm the opposite of you so I have extraverted intuition then introverted feeling then extroverted thinking and then introverted sensing so we're like doing the same thing we're just doing in the opposite order so I really respect you guys a lot I have a lot to learn from you and I think that we can have really cool conversations but for those of you who are watching who are not an ISTJ take a little more time to respect and understand your ISTJ friends take a little time to realize that they're not boring they're actually pretty darn interesting take a little time to recognize how what they do is actually incredibly valuable and very helpful and with that I will leave you guys stay cool is cjs and stay open everybody else to the possibility that is TJ's might just be one of the coolest personality alright guys until next time bye
