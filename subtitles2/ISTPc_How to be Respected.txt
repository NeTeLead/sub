 hey Mac Monroe here with today's thought for the day you know today's thought is all about respect you know you hear this all the time people say I've been disrespected nobody respects me respect means that you're being taken seriously so if you think you're not being respected maybe you need to think about things that will turn that around for example are you using your brain are you using your intelligence if not people won't take you seriously how do you talk to other people do you use the right tone of voice if not people won't take you seriously think about the way that you dress if it's something that people won't take seriously you won't get their respect respect is something that you earn respect is really easy to lose once it's lost it's hard to get back so this week ask yourself how can I be better respected on my peers hey have a great afternoon and again any questions you can find me at Tennessee mac.com that's Tennessee ma ck com have a great day
