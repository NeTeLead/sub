 hey guys it's Laila and I'm back from the new video so this video is going to be all about my software engineering journey and where it all started where I'm at and move it what I want to do the future and all that good stuff and I hope it short video talk to you like that but hopefully I will win in say a get currently sounds of software engineering it all started when I started my internship so at the moment I'm doing a four-year course so it's computer science with artificial intelligence and here English so I'm currently in my industry here at the moment and I've been at a source for eight months so far as a software engineer intern so make sure you this is where it all started and before that I did do a software engineering module in my second year and I kind of got an insight on what software engineering is all about in terms of testing in terms of working a team in terms of requirements customer requirements business requirements also I learned about agile and scrum yeah about all these concepts that you need soak right into my software engineering internship I kind of knew bits about it but I feel like everything just made sense because I knew all of these terms and keywords and it just made sense like actually working so it's like uni was like a fairy prep and then my internships like the practical exercise because I'm actually in a theme of working on software to me and doing all these different things so yeah it was really cool you know what my journey starts now that's that's the crazy thing about it right now back-end developments on the back ends of the engineer and a lot of the work here on c-sharp coding and working in visual Studios to create a lot of different types of tests and a lot of different type of api's and all that good stuff if you don't know these concepts please look it up and learn more about it because this is which should be the starting point but yeah that's currently what I'm doing at the moment so in terms of my journey because this is the very beginning and I don't really have a lot of the gems tell you guys apart from be enough work and obviously I'll tell you guys a little bit more about my role I'll tell you guys that this is just kind of let you guys know I'm literally just starting and if you're considering doing software engineering as a career as of now this is the video you and these other videos this is the Chatham meeting so yeah so oh yes so right journey starts now once I'm done with my internship I can grab all that information that I've learned and use that elsewhere where it's in my evening or other jobs or the same job and yeah that's bitch mean what doing at the moment I don't really know it's a talk about software journeys because I have a big hit for long time but yeah but my goal is to get better at Cody so to be honest you guys I am actually able get very much maybe I'm opens a dream but I have a beginner and I need to learn how to you know code by myself make my project that's what I'm planning to do I'm planning to build my own app and I want to build it as a business so that's something that I would like to introduce a future I just currently just coding around that just to practice and get more better at it so yeah that's that's the point where I'm like now there's so many men who just are gonna learn like PI for a law like there's so many different languages that one learn especially on the data science book so yeah this kind of is a contradictory video because I've loved learning about data science I find it so so interesting if you guys want to know a little bit more about that please comment below or like this video but yeah so I'm hoping to finish my degree and then go back into work whether it's back at a source or a different role and I've always felt a bit skeptical about trying to like if it if I don't go back to a source like triangle to the platform another job because I feel like I'm not that experienced to programming but like I don't let that not done because I didn't really have that much experience when I started my internship and I learned so much and I've developed so much so yeah I'm not gonna let that bring me down that much but I feel like in my last year evening I'm probably good practice a lot so I can get to a point where I'm actually confident and happy but yeah if you guys know or suggest any food OD websites or books please comment below and I will write them as well and once I'm actually quite amusing but yeah I've mentioned in the beginning of time guys I am a beginner if you're looking up let's get looking art and then tie these two friends together I'm just learning a lot and I'm pairing a lot with people with my team and I'm actually contributed a lot so I thought like I didn't value to the team that I am it's all engineering stuff like that but I don't know I just feel like you know if you know your potential and if you just code a little bit more and just work a little bit harder we'll just be like this that's what that's the point that I have so my journey at the moment right now I just need to practice coding period if you are like me and you're lazy and you just sleep when you get home watch movies watch Netflix stop well don't stop but please put some time in for coding as well because honestly every day counts at the bank get the less harder it is for you to understand and let it just be a language where you just understand it but you don't have to write it I was gonna say speech you don't have to write it so that's the point where I might take my advice start paving yeah I think you guys liked this video was informative hopefully in the next two years I will be doing an update software to be a journey app you know I'll be through the room I'll be I'll be at the top hey guys I enjoyed this video I got the day and I'll see those and see [Music]
