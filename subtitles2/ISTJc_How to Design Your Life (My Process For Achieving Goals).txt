 I had a coaching client last year say something that was incredibly wise when he hired me and in other words I took him on as a coaching client he said you know Alex the reason that I wanted to be your client is because I want to be where you are in a few years and I know you did not get there by accident you design your life and I thought that was extremely wise and spot-on because the thing is so many of us wake up when we're 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 and realized we don't even know why we got here or how we're here and we know for sure that this is not where I wanted to be where we wanted to be years and years ago now in this video I want to share my personal process I use for not only scripting the direction of your life but how I reinvented my own life and consciously created it from 26 until 30. what's up guys Alex Hein here author of the book master of the day now in my own life here really I think that designing your life and making go forward in the direction you wanted to go forward has three parts and the very first part is the design the second part is the habits you use are you doing a daily basis and the third is the follow three weather follow-up in other words how do you actually stay on track when you get off track because half of the game of goal achievement is purely when you get punched in the face what are you gonna do differently to get back up and get back in the fight now for me the first thing is vision it's basically the design you know if you just sit down for a day you pour a coffee you get on a piece of paper and you write down what would be the coolest thing that could happen over the next five years in my life if you just do that you are already ahead of 99% of humanity who show up with no game plan no vision for the future no clue what they would like to create besides you know I would like more money or I'd like that girl or that guy or I'd like a nicer car there's almost no consciousness or conscious energy giving me thinking about what do I want to build in the future like what consciously and concretely do I want to improve so for me the way that I do that is first of all I have a journal where I'm regularly writing down updates for the kind of life that I want to build you know it starts with the vision which makes me think of the fact that the skyscrapers of New York started with a picture in somebody's head and so did spaceships and so it in curing a difficult disease and so when I think of it like that I always make sure I'm consciously creating even it is just in my thoughts even if it's just up there both in print journals and in a document that I call five years from today so the three things that I use for my yearly envisioning are one the yearly envisioning process I've talked about here which is basically at the start of each year I write down what is the coolest thing that could happen this year like perfect year no limitations no just be realistic but like what would be the coolest thing that could happen I put it on one piece of paper that's always on my desk and single day and I review it twice per day now from there that yearly document also has my daily habits the unique projects I'm working on in each quarter of the year as well as the things I know that I need to work on to get better basically to improve myself the second thing is the pocket journal I carry around this for me is always to record things that may change about my thinking ideas I get when I read or listen to podcasts as well as little intuitive hunches that come up so if I'm talking to a friend or I'm reading a book and I'm like wow that would be an awesome idea for example that's where all my books came from wouldn't it be cool to dot-dot-dot I put it down in his little book it's just a little three by five moleskin that I always carry around with me and then day by day I can flip through that and be like you know what these were those cool things I wanted to basically manifest and create in my own life let me just keep a note of them the second way I do that is by doing a weekly journal page now the weekly journal page is just a strategy page which I talked about in my recent video on journaling for success and in that strategy page it's basically where are you Alex where do you want to be and are those habits you're doing every day sufficient enough to actually get you there so the whole point of this journal page is reflection you're doing this are you still on track if not what has to change and then finally I have this little journal notebook a digital notebook in Evernote and it just says five years from today now I don't really stick with that idea of five years from today but the point for me is where do I want to go in what direction it could be as simple as moving like I know I'm moving to California after I'm done with my doctorate in Portland it could be as simple as the relationship you want to be in for example I'm thirty I know that I want to be married by 35 so I can have that there I know that I want to have a private practice and a traditionally published book and three for vacations per year I put all of that down where I don't know how I'm gonna make it happen yet but it will happen for sure I haven't quite fleshed out the process the point is that you're putting trajectories in your brain and in your subconscious and when you check that every once in a while they're kind of like oh yeah I knew I wanted to do that but all right let's start thinking about how I can actually do it and almost all of those things come true for me especially if you regularly review that now the second piece here is your habits so the daily action steps that you're gonna actually do to make that a reality now I've shared this philosophy many times it makes up the bulk of my book master of the day but the point is that you think about the goals you want to reach and then you have to break them down forget the goal but break it down into a daily habit so with Fitness you forget losing 30 pounds the habit is cook every day go to the gym 20 minutes a day you want to write a book you forget having written a book you put down the habit right 500 words a day you want to be in an amazing relationship in two years you forget that goal you put the habit I'm gonna go out to four events where I might meet like-minded people and that's your daily habit so you bring it back to what do I have to do today now the way I track that is a combination of ways so not only in that yearly visioning document do I put that I also record it in Evernote and the reason I do that is because every Thursday I have a 30 to 45 minute mastermind call now I've had a personal mastermind for over four years now every single week and it's basically started when I started my business because that was so difficult for me but it progressed to like are you happy are you building the life you want are you is your ladder up against the right wall as the saying goes because you might climb the ladder of success and realize you climbed the wrong ladder and you're not where you want to be so it's also about conscious goal setting and being crystal clear on the path forward making sure you're going down the right path you want to be down so I actually have a maximum of three goals per year and then three habits per goal for example the goals are often much more complex than you think like let's say you've only been sleeping five hours a night while your daily ritual that may have to be I'm gonna disconnect from the computer at 11:00 I'm not gonna have coffee after 5:00 and I'm not gonna stress myself out with homework or with work after a certain time it may take a few habits just like doing well in school or high performing at your work may also be more than one-handed it may mean I'm gonna study this study strategy everyday and apply that or I'm gonna do an extra one hour of work per day or self-study or something else the way that I personally do it is just three habits per actual goal and those I track in a weekly scorecard document which is these are the three things did I do them Monday through Sunday and then when I get to my Thursday night mastermind we all get on the phone and I basically give a report I did this 50% of the time 90% of the time this is what didn't work this is what I have to improve and then the third part for me about consciously designing your life and going forward is really just two things it's the follow-through to make sure you actually do these things and then number two its following little intuitions about when you have to pivot so the way I keep the follow-through going is every night I do a little master the day journal page the journals that out yet but I still have a print kind of document that I use for tracking did I do this where do I have to improve myself the Thursday mastermind which is a 45-minute call we use uber conference for free you could do the exact same with a few of your friends or people online my very first mastermind was totally online people I'd met that were other internet entrepreneurs now from there I have the Thursday mastermind I have the weekly strategy journal page and I have my Divi habit tracking and besides those three things all I do is carry around in that little pocket moleskin journal I told you about because then I feel like if something doesn't feel right at all like you're off track you don't like this job you're gaining someone and you realize something's not right I write down the intuitions because I can always consciously articulate the next move sometimes is easy I want to move to California all the times it's not do I stay in this relationship is this business still what really excites me am i proud of all the work I've created those are things that may be better governed by your intuition and better understood so I just keep a log of all the little intuitive impressions and then I systematically explore them more and then I take time to just go through them and see what's behind them and I pack them so I hope that was you guys that's a little bit about my process for consciously scripting your life which has been my whole shtick for a while and that's really the thing that made the biggest difference for me going from 2425 where I had done nothing impressive with my life very average student hadn't done much besides traveled to now really contributing and producing a lot and having had a productive life the last five or so years now before you go I want you to leave a comment there below let me know for you if you could consciously script your life what would be the first thing you think is important hey guys well one of the things that goes along with being in Sage Mode like I talked about here is being calm and being Sage now the biomat is a pad you can put on your bed or on the floor which uses technology that was actually discovered by NASA to help you reduce stress and fatigue now it produces negative ions which are considered nature's energizer and these negative ions you can find in abundance in places like forests and mountains waterfalls and oceans now the biomat in particular is comprised of three parts that helps you have that stress relief and that fatigue relief now the biomat can also help with pain relief and circulation it is FDA cleared and one of the cool things is that it profoundly affects both the nervous system while also promoting deep relaxation so it kind of has this dual energizing and relaxing effect also the people at the biomat store recommend and encourage you to call for personalized customer service and advice it's kind of unique among companies now that basically don't want to deal with you so that is worth investigating as well and like some customers have said it's really restorative so a direct quote from one person was that it's the world's greatest power nap check out the biomat link here on the screen or in the description box there below if you'd like to find out more information on it
