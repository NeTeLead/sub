 [Music] hey guys welcome to another video happy to suck it's actually true sucking career and now for those are guys who may not know what Chuseok is it's actually Thanksgiving Day in Korea and also it's just a time where friends and families and relatives get together eat good food spend a good time and also watch TV shows you know because in Korea there's a lot of Chuseok specials and each variety show or TV shows will be airing like pilot shows or even shows that aren't normally aired so for example Idol star athletics competitions are always going on around Chuseok time and also even the New Year's time so I thought that I'll just be really fun to kind of talk about it because I know that I got to a lot of questions ever since I made Idol insider I know that this was a very highly requested topic because it's kind of not talked about a lot other than like you know you could see idols dating each other like you know but other than that there are a lot of things that you guys asked and I'm gonna be talking about it like I said before I have been taking in questions on my stories so those you guys who want to contribute and also ask questions for Idol and setter on the topics follow me on Instagram and it's Sabini underscore and also don't forget to follow me on youtube don't forget to subscribe and yeah let's get with the video so the first thing that i want to talk about is it's gonna be going through it in the order that I kind of just have it here so how do you get tickets so I would have to say for each idol group the amount of fans that you can kind of omit into the fan section is gonna be different basically the more popular you are the more fans you can actually have there brooding for you I know this is kind of like bias but it is because since they do have more fans that they're gonna have a bigger section for the fans so basically how you get the tickets is not like you can kind of like I don't know buy the tickets basically most of the times if the company is you know told how many tickets are gonna be for example like if it was a goop and then they get 500 tickets or 500 tickets for the fans and basically then this will go over to the fan cafe and then from the fan cafes that is how it's going to be kind of be given to I know it can be kind of given as like first come first serve or you know each fan cafe is going to be doing it differently on how they are going to be managing to give out the tickets to the fans so basically you gotta be in a fan cafe if you do want to kind of get the tickets or yeah that's how you're gonna get tickets how long does it last this is a really good question it has the whole day I would say that this is probably the longest building that I remember from a lot of the variety shows that I've done I would have to say it was the most difficult as well basically it starts recording at like a really early time like 7:00 so in order to get ready you got to go to the hair salon at 4:00 get ready go to wherever the gymnasium is gonna be and then wait till they start bringing everybody in one by one stay backstage so much things that are going on so this is a really good question also how to male idols and female idols interact so I would say that the most easy way to interact with each other is basically backstage because there aren't cameras rolling and also because once you're in the gymnasium and you're in the center of the gymnasium while all the fans are watching you you are not gonna be wanting to interact with any male IO or any female Idol because all eyes are on you so basically even if you just want to kind of like do like small talk it has to be real quick because then fans are getting back oh my god so-and-so is talking to so and so and the whole fandoms and it's just not a pretty situation and you don't want to deal with that so so another question that I got is happy personally participated in ISAC do you guys say it is EC or Hawk Earth I don't know whatever I'm doesn't say is IC because I don't want to like you know film this whole video saying at the way but I chain has personally participated in is EC and I would have to say that it was very interesting I didn't get to participate in a sport and actually I really wanted to participate but you aren't given a lot of chances sometimes if you are a more of a rookie group I'm gonna be talking more about this later because I feel like I saw questions talking more about this so it's gonna be going about that but yes I have participated is a real competition or is it just to have fun I mean does it have an influence on the group's career yes and no I would say that it is a real competition and some groups might do it just for fun if they don't really have confidence on whatever sports they're doing but I would say that for the rookies it is a real competition because it is a time for screen time and basically it's really hard to get screen time and if you're gonna be getting screen time with that much idols it's just that much better to be getting the screen time and getting your group out there so I feel like a lot of people really do try and I feel like that is the sport and mind you should have when you're in a competition or even if it's a variety show you know that's something that's very important and also does it have an influence on the group's career I would say that this is also half in half because in the beginning I SEC was really really really popular I feel like it was super popular like when it first started off like wow like that was like the true talk like that was this hard you know programs it was the number one you know and then I feel like as time goes by it did kind of lose its popularity but a lot of people still watching a lot of fans don't really watch it so I would say that it does impact the group's career but not as big as it did long time ago long time ago if one member did really good in a sport then all the other variety shows they would call that member because that's the only reference that they had but nowadays there's so many references that you can like through SNS or you know reality TV show so it's really different can you really tell who is dating in a sec uh for me personally I couldn't really tell me because I wasn't really like concentrated to see oh my god I'm gonna see who's dating so-and-so but they say that you can tell but for me personally when I was there with a bunch of people I feel like it's just such a crazy environment that you don't really pay attention because if you think about it you have thousands and thousands of different fans watching you and also you're kind of being concentrated on the sport that you're kind of gonna be doing and there's so many idols around you that it's just like really hard to just pinpoint like out like who's dating I mean if you were wanting to do that I guess you can point it out but for me that wasn't something that I was very like interested in so I didn't look at that so then the question that I got is hi Christine there are a lot of rumors that if you reject MBC's invitation for ISAC that they will ban you from future shows over not invite you as much is that really true I wouldn't necessarily say that they ban you from NBC or just like ban you from variety shows but they will be very disappointed for I would have to say that this usually goes for when the group gets popular over time so for example let's to say that there was a rookie group in like the beginning stages and they weren't that popular when they first came out on ISAC or their first is AC and then over like a couple years they got like really famous and then basically is AC is like oh hey come out on a sec but then if they're like no they might be like giving you the go p-- ship like what are you talking about like when you guys read Opie's we hoped you guys a lot or they might have a negotiation like okay only film this certain segment or only do this certain sport and might have a little easier way out but at the same time a lot of fans really like it when their idols are on is AC so which is another reason why the companies might be like okay you know what like just do it but then don't have them filled for the whole day because that's just like really draining on the body and for the and since the idols are really busy they might not even have time to film the whole day so basically that's one like the negotiation can come along but I would say that they definitely will be disappointed if you don't go on the show so how do they choose the groups I would have to say that the groups are chosen by the producers and editors usually it's really hard to choose the group's if they are a rookie because you don't really know their talents but if they have been on the show for a while they might be putting out and kind of like having a little bit of just a preference of what they think is gonna be fair and they're going to be putting the teams together usually teams that are in the same company as well like the same entertainment they might be in one group and that's how they might be kind of organizing it I feel like for each like a sec it's always going to be different though what is the purpose of ISAC why did they have it every year I mean it's cool though I would say that the purpose of it is because most of the time they have it on New Year's and also Thanksgiving so it's a time where everyone's kind of home and just watching TV so it's basically like really good screen time good exposure and at the same time it's kind of like a ritual so I feel like NBC kind of wants to go through with it all the time and also if you are Ricky idol group you do want to go on it as well so it's kind of like a win-win all the time for both NBC and for the rookie groups is it rigged I wouldn't say it's rigged but the show producers and writers might know if you know so-and-so is actually really good in that certain sport and then might pair them with a lower team so basically like I don't know if one group is really good at archery and they're more of a higher group they might be you know putting you up against a group that is just like very new to archery so that you know it can kind of be fun and that that group that's more popular can go up higher which groups are the most competitive I wouldn't really necessarily say that like there's certain idol groups that are more it definitely there are some idol groups I could be taking it more seriously but I would say that the rookie groups are the groups that are the most competitive because you're like trying to live with all of the idols out there and China you know get some screen time so I would say that this is basically a show that a lot of rookie IR group's definitely tend to show light and do their best when it's filming time how much practice goes into it before the competition usually I remember when our group was preparing to go on a sec one member was actually going to be picked for the running segment and it was a sprint 100-meter sprint and I remember basically it wasn't like a set member so basically all five members ran from me that this is about like three times to see who won and who's the most fastest and then after that basically that member was only one practicing but if you are in more like a team sport I would say that you tend to practice more frequently or when you do have a lot of time and the more busier the group I mean they're not gonna have more time to practice but the more you know rookie they are or if they really want to do well in the sport then they will practice more which competition do you think that you'll do the best in a little backstory I did track for seven years elementary school junior high school and a little bit of high school so I would have to say that track is think I'm the most confident in I would really like to do the relay and also the sprint but I haven't had in a really long time so I don't know if I would be good can boy groups and girl groups talk to each other basically backstage you can and I think that the easiest way to talk to them is if one of your group members know another group member then you can kind of casually talk with their group and then the members will casually talk to that's usually how it goes because that's the most natural way or when they're passing out snacks you can kind of like EB eating your snacks and then talk a little bit to at the same time there's managers so a lot of idols at same time we'll kind of like not try to talk because then they're gonna like get in trouble by the manager so I mean you do a low-key or you just do a mainstream and like you know kind of do it like off the bat very naturally like it's nothing and then yeah then the managers might think okay yeah they're just like originally close and then they just might leave it but then if you look like you're trying to like get at them like oh hey like and also you know what's your name no how you doing then the manager might be like okay cut it out cut it out how are idols treat it in the event so originally I was gonna say this question in this video but I feel like it's a little bit longer and it's a little bit more like serious on just my personal experience so what I'm gonna be doing is if this video gets up to 3,000 likes I will be telling you guys my personal story on is AC because for me it personally wasn't the best and I kind of want to explain to you guys why I felt that way but only if it gets up to beat doesn't like so o press the like button if you guys want to hear about what happens yes where the winners and losers planned usually they aren't planned the sport and just the competition really is a competition it's just a matter of how serious the idols are taking the competition to be and it's usually not planned having made any friends at this event mmm I personally didn't meet any friends because I'm not the type of person to kind of like engage in the conversation I feel like I kind of regret that though because it is a place where it's easy to talk to idols because there's so much and you have so much downtime because you're literally in this gymnasium in that one place for a really long time from when I was filming so basically I think that it is a really great way to make friends but personally I didn't make any friends while I was there where some idols not given the opportunity to participate and only call to show their face um yeah basically there are a lot of groups that only one member might be able to perform in but the whole group comes to kind of cheer them on and also have screen time so basically for the members who aren't on the show it is a little bit boring but I mean if you're all about that dance I mean it's fine to what is EC be considered an easy day for idols definitely not that is probably the hardest day for idols because you wake up around three four go to the shop goes along and then go to wherever you need to film and then be filming the whole day nowadays I feel like it's a little bit easier because the sports are divided into different like sections so you know you might not need to be filming for a long time but back in the day when I was on a sec I remember it was a whole freaking day literally did fans of smaller groups get to go in they get to go in but not as much as the bigger groups there's definitely like a set fan thing I'd remember for our group it was only about like fifty and like other groups it could be like 200 or like 300 it's just like very different for each group so yeah it kind of sucks but I mean it makes sense the bigger the group the more fans are gonna have and the more fans are gonna want to come to root for them so while reading a lot of us actually thought about a certain scenario that I remember that happened so ha obvious is it when you know two idols are dating what are some signs they actually and I'm just gonna be you know telling the T because I'm live in an idol group anymore so basically I remember one of my members was dating another boy group member and that boy group member was also at a sec and obviously the members know you know in our group and then that board group members know so basically you just kind of talk casually like your friends if you really do want to talk in a conversation or if not like you do not want to just say to them at all then they'll just kind of gave him like eye contact and I just thought that it was super funny because they decided not to talk to each other it's it's like a rule like the day before it's like okay are you gonna play it out casually like friendly or are you gonna play it out like you guys don't know each other they played a lot like they didn't know each other and it's just so funny because we see our member and we see that group and like they're constantly doing like eye contact so I guess this is where the eye contact kind of goes in if they know so that is kind of true it just depends on how you want to take the situation if you want to kind of be cool about it or if you want to be like super secretive about it I feel like the more secretive you are the more it's obvious because I was like it's like so obvious you guys to just talk like you know like make it casual like I feel like that's gonna be less obvious instead of like giving you guys I contact but that's what they decide to do do you get to choose what color track suits you where you do not get to choose what color traction where I wish because sometimes some groups get super pretty color shock suits and I'm like damn why am i rain this super orange tracksuit or like this like super purple tracksuit but basically how the track suits are given is after a poop is finalized for the show then there'll be just be giving like colors randomly for the groups and then if your group gets a good color then you're lucky but you do not get to choose but I know that a lot of groups when they're they're like oh my god I wish I had the like the gray tracksuit or I wish I had the black tracksuit I remember like we used to always talk about that because you get to keep the track suits at the end and if you're having like a super like orange Chuck suit or a no purple track suit like you know they're wearing that so the group skin invited or whoever wants to participate can go oh man I wish whoever wants to participate can go then I would have gotten I would have won every year but there are so many idols and there are so many idols who really do want to be on the show and not a lot of Iowa's are given the privilege to and I say this like a privilege because it really is hard to go on ISAC because usually the writers only pick the most like relevant one so basically if they are recently made a comeback or you know if they're on TV more often and I would say that it's really hard and at the same time if you are rookie you aren't going to be going on many sports competitions so you might only be going on one sport and it just kind of sucks like if you really like tried your best but you lost because you don't have any other time to kind of show screen time and that's just the sad truth about it it really sucks is it too many idols avoid ISAC because they get hurt easy this is very true if they are going to do a comeback the company might not let them go on the show especially because a comeback is very important and you do not want to get injured before you go on like music show programs and if you haven't even like gone on the me the show program so what they will usually do is they'll tell the you know writers really sorry but we're preparing for a comeback and it's gonna be soon and we don't want to like you know cause any injuries so we're not going to be participating then the writers if they really really want the good to come then nothing okay then we'll put you on a you know competition where you don't you know use a lot of your body and that's how they'll kind of negotiate but most of times a lot of companies might back out from it because it is true you do get hurt and you don't want to get hurt before promotions at all so how do you think the atmosphere is inside there I would say that it's pretty clicky and very selective in a way I say this because usually you're only talking to the people that you already know and it's not really easy to initiate and engage in a conversation with a group that's kind of new and a group that you never knew if you are more of like a social butterfly and you do not mind talking to them and do not mind putting yourself out there then it's fine but at the same time a lot of cameras are on you and all the same time a lot of fans are watching you so unless you guys are like the same gender this is like a really risky factor and not a lot of Isles will talk to other idols and they'll just just talk within their group and unless they know somebody from another group then they won't really talk so I would say that it's very cliquey and secluded and you only talk to the people that you already knew before and yet the last question is two companies force the idols to participate I feel like a lot of idols that have filmed ISAC will know how tiring it is because it's super tiring it tastes like almost the whole day and it's a very long process because after you win a competition then you have to be semi finals and the finals and then it just is a lot of time and a lot of filming so I feel like the more popular you get the more you do not want to film it since when you're a rookie you want more screen time and you want to kind of get your group out there but then when you're famous they don't all want to film for a long time so they'll actually just negotiate with the company will okay we'll go on ISAC but we're only gonna do one sport and after the sport is done like we don't want to film then if the manager tells that to the writer and the writer is okay with it then the bigger idol groups will go on this show I hope you guys enjoyed this video I had a really fun time making it like I said if this video gets up to 3,000 likes I will talk about my personal ISAC experience and the honest experience because I feel like it's a whole video in itself so yes with you guys on the video like this video don't forget to Like comment and subscribe please subscribe it would really mean a lot to me but also turn on the post notification bell the little Bell because you guys I'm going to be informed every time a new video is up and it's really been a long time since I filmed the idol insider video but I'm so happy that I did and it feels really good to be kind of like talking about of the camera again and yeah I hope you guys have a good Chuseok and see you in the next one bye [Music] you.
