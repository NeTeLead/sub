 hey world is Sheela and first of all I'm so excited I want to thank you guys for subscribing to my channel and all your likes and I have hit 100 subscribers. it's funny because I started this channel just to kind of work on expressing myself and being you know secure in just getting myself out there and not being afraid of the tribe and getting attacked by the tribe because oh I think is f Peas it is really hard to put ourselves out there for critique for any type of backlash I mean I I'm just always terrified of yeah being attacked um I don't know other ISPs do you guys experienced that just that fear but just putting ourselves out there and not knowing what's gonna happen it's probably that that and I being a little lower of woo not being able to predict the future and what's the outcome and so maybe that's a little bit of that so today's topic is about reasons and why for me it is almost impossible to want to give reasons and I think the thinking part in being an ISP is lower obviously our te is fourth and we work in the realm of feelings and just being secure in how we feel about things in general our values our likes and don't likes and what we want to do it just it's all kind of just we go into ourselves the time and if something comes up I'm like huh and I go in I check with myself is this right is this morally what I want to be is this what I want to do is this does it line up with who I am at my being so when the outside world is asking us for the reasons I'm like I don't know because it's just the way I am it's just the way I feel it's the way I think it's the way I I am I don't so an example of that is somebody asked me well what's your favorite color and like oh it's pink why do you like pink and I had to think about it because my first response is always well just because or I don't know and so I have to really kind of take the time like okay why do I like pink and I said well I think pink is pretty and they're like but why do you think you know why why do you think pink is pretty why do you like it and I'm like well pink is pretty because I like it and it's just this like circle of I can't give like a logical argument of why I like it I am always coming from a feeling base of why I like something and I have a hard time putting the words to it like so if somebody says okay what hobby do you like or what's your favorite hobby or something and I'm like well I like sewing and I'll say well why do you like sewing and I can kind of give it a little more reasons I think the reasons are there my reasons like well I like sewing because I love to be creative I love to work with my hands and I love creating something for beauty so those are kind of reasons why I like sewing and to me I think those are good reasons are they are they logically sound I don't know are they more feeling basis sound I have a hard time parsing out the difference between my Fi and my te I mean because they do work together but my Fi is just like this a huge part of me and then my T's like this little baby part and like I don't know I just like it because don't ask me don't give me it don't make me give reasons for why I want to do something why I did something why. anything yeah and I don't like to argue in general and I think a lot of isfps are Enneagram 9 I think a lot the other rows like a four fours and 9s tend to be the highest I think 9 being the highest so we don't like to argue one probably because we are not good at logically block banging the reasons in the external world for an argument I just find myself shutting down I'm just like if somebody comes at me hardcore with an argument and it's something I'm not you know very passionate about or something I really believe I'm like mmm that's I just back off I'm like okay and and it's all fine and dandy I don't want to join that argument I don't want to think about it I just want to feel um now if somebody's coming at me with a belief of mine like so say they're arguing about my identity and this comes off um comes up you know often on just when you put yourself out there in the MBTI people are always gonna have their opinions about your type and I know 100% I'm isfp there are some people out there that still want to argue that and when it comes up I want to just fight like tooth and nail and I want to be seen I want to be heard I want them to just know they're wrong that I'm right I know me best I Know Who I am I know exactly what makes me tick I know what makes me feel I mean I just get passionate and like no and so I think that cat energy being backed up backed up into the corner of someone questioning your identity I just want to come out claws full-blown and and fight because I know they don't know me I know me and so I think that's why when we're identity is challenged one of our true beliefs and core values are challenged that's when we will be like fight fight and you will see that side of the isp where you're like whoa look at you go you know like because we're so passive in general and easygoing until you stop on us then we become these little rabid kittens yeah a rabid kitten because we're still sweet we still come at it like no not full force mean and evil it's like just yeah like a rabid kitten or a rabid bunny so yeah and especially for reasons too I don't like explaining why I value what I value why I believe what I believe I just do it's really hard to put words to why I I have those it's like it's like it's just there from the beginning of time with your values and your beliefs like. there's no like big epiphany or anything like that it's just like oh yeah I've always believed that that's what I believe this is what I think this is how I feel and I've never there's not a point in my life where I'm like oh I became you know I really started believing this or I can't explain it I'm gonna ramble if I try to get too hardcore into explaining things trying to te my way out of it out of my box now where I see like te working for me that I'm really really good at is making things work in the extent external world I am very good at hands-on making things work like for example one day I was sitting in my kitchen I'm gonna go on a little story and I know I was sitting in my dining room looking into my kitchen and I'm like ah I hate my kitchen my kitchen is ugly and I got up walked into the garage grabbed my husband's sledgehammer came back in and I started smashing the walls the cabinets and went to town on remodeling my kitchen didn't ask the husband didn't even process it I just was like I want to do this I'm gonna do it and I did it I remember husband coming home from work and he walked in the house and there's sheetrock on the ground and holes in the wall and cabinets all torn apart and he goes oh I guess we're remodeling in the kitchen and I said yeah I guess we are Oh six months later and $40,000 later I had my dream kitchen I had envisioned while I was sitting there and looking at it and we did everything ourselves we did all the demo ourselves all the putting back together patching the hardwood floors we had cabinet people come in and install the cabinet's but other than that hang lighting and recessed lighting sheetrock I mean I'm in there with the drill gun sheetrocking taping mudding I do all that stuff myself because I'm really handy when it comes to that kind of stuff and I'm not afraid to do it it's just like I will tackle any project and it just it's just easy for me to see how it's going to play out in my head I have a vision I know the steps to take and I take them and I think that's te just being able to pick up a screwdriver and start working it without even knowing how to like I don't research a whole lot I just I mean if I get stuck on something I'll go to youtube and watch a quick video of a few minutes maybe somebody taping and I'm like okay that looks easy this is what you do and mud it and I'm super good at like you know floating the mud out and standing it and smoothing I'm just super handy very very very handy handy with power tools handy at any of that stuff remodeling furniture redoing stuff it just comes naturally and I think you have to have te pretty up there to be able to just feel confident in it and enjoy that kind of stuff if something breaks down in my house I'm not afraid to tackle it a lot of times my husband will do it because he enjoys it also or I don't know if he enjoys it so much as he just he's good at figuring stuff out also and so yeah we we tackle all kinds of projects we've remodeled quite a few homes from you know tearing down to the studs and redoing it ourselves we're kind of like the chip and Joanna Gaines and but I can be chip as well I'm right I have an eye for design as well and I can be the Joanna Gaines but I would rather I like getting in there and demoing and getting physical it's like swiping a sledgehammer against a sheetrock wall is exhilarating and like I just love it I love watching it smash and the powder just poof in you know oh I'm getting this all worked up all right so that's just a little bit about reasons and maybe I'm explaining T maybe I'm not I don't know it's not something I'm very versed in I can talk about my Fi all day long but te it's just a little baby alright well thank you oh and um I'm gonna leave you with a little tidbit today don't be a salty heifer all right here let me do that better don't be a salty heifer it's not the best but I saw this shirt and I'm like oh I have to have it and nothing worse than being out in public and dealing with salty heifers so don't be a salty heifer today bye
