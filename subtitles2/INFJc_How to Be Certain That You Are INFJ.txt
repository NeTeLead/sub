 hi everyone its Ren here I hope you're doing well in this video I would like to return to the question of MBC I and particularly INF Janus there's this question and it's a question that tends to appear a lot in the conversations that people have by the NF J's sometimes it's themselves sometimes they're not sure whether it is what they are and what I'm gonna talk about in this video is basically ways to figure out whether you are infj or not outside of the tests that are provided online you will hear that you know the tests are unreliable we all know that so I'm not going to cover this particular topic I'll just leave it aside as something that we have agreed upon if you get infj with an online test this does not mean that sure 9f j just in the same way that if you guess something else than infj in an online test this does not mean that you are not infj so a lot of the time what you hear is that to figure out whether you are an infj you need to sort of you need to look at the functions so this is obviously a recommendation that I would have for anyone who identifies as infj but is not particularly convinced or certain yes that they are nfj because I what I know is that INFJs tend to be among the people and let me know guys if you agree with this they tend to be among the people who are the most likely to keep questioning their type and they will not easily be satisfied that there are certain that they are this type okay and so maybe this could be a way for you guys to just settle on it finally right because INFJs question all the time the question all the time and this is a product of being an i and i dominant and not using te i think but in any case you want to study the functions sure but for the you are either not familiar with the functions and for those also that maybe are a little bit familiar with the functions but they're not quite sure about how to go about them exactly what they mean right maybe I can give some tips or at least I can give you a perspective that for my part has really helped me to identify my type for sure okay so when you look at the function stack you know it's an IFV T is C interpreted intuition extraverted feeling introverted thinking and extroverted sensing so that's that that's the archetype okay but you have to keep in mind that you have function tests online and you can take some of those functions tests but they will have the same problems they will they had the exact same issue that the other tests have so you can have certain tests that are more or less reliable about it Academy is you can have certain functions tests that are reliable but the confirmation bias answering what you wish you were rather than what you really are answering what's your opinion about something rather than what you would really do yourself that's also going to crop up in the in the functions test so the functions tests are useful but again not the ideal when you study your type and you study the functions you want to look really carefully into the definition of introverted intuition and I I made videos on introverted intuition on my channel so if you just type search you know for introverted intuition or if you look just browse through my channel you can check a video called introverted intuition in action I'll link it below in this in this video so that you can you can get a sense of how I relate to my own introverted intuition to see if you relate to it so research introverted intuition see if it feels familiar to you okay and the thing is I know for a fact that it's not easy to understand interpreting intuition it's a very abstract definition because by almost by nature introvert intuition is hard to talk about it's so abstract and so symbolic and so nonverbal in many ways that once it gets translated into the verbal domain what you will read which which will be your resources sometimes will make it hard for you at first to distinguish say between ne and ni right so perhaps you will have a difficulty distinguishing between ne and ni I'm not going to go into the detail of the functions not but that's fine you know but what's interesting is that if you hesitate in between any and ni at least you know that you're very high on n so you can you can cast aside the sensor types right you're high on n so that's already something interesting because it might suggest that you're a dominant perceiver and if that suggests that your dominant perceiver you already sort of know that you're either a ntp en AF P int J or infj okay so that's that's like a very important thing to figure out you know focus on ni and even if you struggle a bit to distinguish between an eye on an e see if you think n is the most dominant function in your stack because in the difference between an and dominance and an auxilary is at least as important as the difference between a P and a J you know if not more it's probably more because at least the difference is in terms of functions which are related back to Jung's theory whereas the P and J are related to how you manifest your extroverted functions which is I mean sure it has value but I think that the function stock is more interesting now the dominant function is very important because it really is what needs to be your like your main function that is you cannot be an infj if you're not an eye dominance you cannot be an intp if you're not a TI dominance so that's why it's very important but this is important to figure out as well is that that does not mean that your function stack is going to be the exact same as the archetype right if you feel for example that you're a nine I dominance but I hear you're unusually high on Fi or on te or that UTI is not particularly high up and you think that your se is higher or if you feel like your fe could be higher that does not mean that you are not an infj okay if you felt that you were not strong on ni that would mean that you're not on a PG but if if if you are confident that you are strong on ni the other functions they're not if you like they're not the the lens through which you see the world they're not the lens through which you see the world so it's possible to repress to some extent Fe to have andhra develops TI to have slightly over develops SEI no infj is who online to have quite well developed se you know it's it's it's it's a it's a pattern if you like you should never think in terms of I must fit the archetype it's a pattern so you look at your function stack you analyze your different patterns of function use in wit and end this in the way in which you see it quality qualitatively if you look at each function and you think okay I'll use this one I use that one you can take tests to sort of point you towards a resolution and then you compare the pattern of your function use and you look at the you know archetypes of the of the MBTI types and you you match it against the one that looks like it the most right so if you have a functional stack that looks the most like the infj means that you tend towards infj so you basically you can say I identify as an infj and you know is that this preserves the possibility for difference within INFJs and therefore this allows us to have an answer to people who argue that MBTI post people in box is because you you know if you reason in terms of attending towards a type having a function stack that matches best that particular function stack of that particular type then you know that actually makes room for diversity for an infinite amount of diversity so keep that in mind you know now in your in your for functions that you think you use the most and I needs to be dominant and Fe needs to be strong enough alright it's if you if you're Fe is now it's number four or below that number five or seven you're not gonna be an infj but if it's turd you know it maybe you repress it a bit right now of course if it's third and fi is seconds much more likely to be an INTJ but look at the T as well you know it's that's why you need to sort of look at the different patterns it's impossible to quite to match a type perfectly so never think in terms of if there is this function stack and I must see whether I completely identify with it because it's a pattern now it suggests ways to grow you know if you're an infj you probably have the potential to develop TI quite well but maybe for a bunch of reasons you didn't get a developer that well i know INF jsut have rather undeveloped here and there are undoubtedly an IFV people you know basically the higher the function in the archetypal stack the higher the function in the archetypal stack the higher is the most likely it has to be high placed in your stack the lower it is in the archetypal stack from tertiary and inferior especially the more permissive permissible it is for it to be lower in your own function stack so for example your dominant needs to be the dominant archetypal function and i fe your fe needs to be in your top three right TI honestly again i've meta-inf genes you have TI that's like a TI that's quite under those like it might rank at number six and the thing is you won't be might think well maybe then they're not INFJs well I can assure you that I asked myself that question and there were clearly NIF users just happen to have underdeveloped TI it's more likely to have undeveloped TI than it is to have undeveloped fe particularly if you're a younger energy so it doesn't mean that you're not it just means that you can work on it you have a potential for it okay so always thinks in terms of always think in terms of patterns now just to conclude this video some very practical advice some very practical advice a lot of infj is wonder if they are infps okay well there's a very simple well no it's not a very simple solution but there is a solution I think to identify whether you are an INFP or an infj just look into Fi and and look at whether you resonate more with introverted feeling versus extraverted feeling this is assuming that an eye and any you have a bit of trouble differentiating and I understand why that could be the case but the thing is a 9fg an infj can be relatively okay with fi but will never be a dominant fi like it's both it's by definition impossible even it will fi cannot be the auxiliary of an infj so if you look into fi carefully and you look into Fe even if you're not super developed forever even if you're a little bit underdeveloped it will still always be higher than it will be for fi okay and in that way you will just figure out so if you if you like instead of reasoning in terms of am i 9f g or am i an INFP assume that you're an infj or or rather assume that you're an INFP and assume that you're a knife I Dom if you like and see if that makes sense for your life if it doesn't make sense for your life then you can just cast out and INFP the infp side might look like the iron FG type but there are extremely different types and the Dominus Fi of an INFP is completely different than the the the FE auxiliary of nf9 FG and in fact it here the TI of the infj if it's well developed you know will allow you to to basically identify for sure that you're neither INFP nor ENFP okay because the NFP is an INFP so they do not have strong Ti occasionally they can manipulate it well but like they're gonna have some te there but if you use TI then you're not an INFP and an ENFP and if these were the only types that you wonder you might be instead of infj well then you've sorted it if you have strong TI and you wondering about whether you're an INTP see if you could be an a TI dumb intps they live through TI it's it's their lens the way that's ni is for us you know so to be a dominant TI is something very different than to be a tertiary TI so again try to imagine that but if you feel like you're neither an fi dominance because this doesn't really resonate with you if you feel like you can't you're certainly not a TI dominant because this doesn't really resonate with you but you are and you're strong on your n right you're strong on your n and Fe speaks to you more than fi speaks to you I mean you're gonna be an infj you're gonna be an infj so again think in terms of functional patterns and like look at TI look at fi and look at fe if you happen to have difficulties with understanding and INE and their differences i have videos for fe versus fi i have videos on ni and i will soon make a video on TI for an infj and how I perceive TI as being manifested even among the infj is that are not very proficient because even if T is is not very proficient a function for them it is still in a sense functionally their tertiary so they're going to relate to it in a way that will have similarities with the usage of other INFJs okay so I'll make a video on TI tertiary for our averages and I perceive it in my own life for you guys to help you further identify whether you think you are infj or another type okay that's all for the video enjoy the rest of your day guys take care
