 hi my name is Masha I'm the blonde from coding blonde and if you guys are following me on Instagram you might know that I have recently gotten a life upgrade essentially because I have a workspace now and I have this awesome stand-up desk from uplift desk Hey look at it go and since then I've become so much more productive and I've learned a ton about where space organization productivity and all that stuff so wants to give you five ways in which you can upgrade your workspace to become more productive and tip number one is make a clear distinction between work and play / relaxation area I can't stress this enough it's actually from personal experience make sure your mind knows where it can relax and where it should focus it has to understand that these areas are different and it's especially important for those of us who are working from home because it's super easy to get distracted when you're working from a sofa or your bed you know the places where you're used to relaxing or having fun you know browsing the internet shopping online and so if you're trying to work there you might wake up having shopped online for three hours and that's not exactly productive is it but the same principle can apply to your office make sure that you are working at your desk and if you need to take care of some personal stuff or again go shopping online we do need to do that sometimes try to do that somewhere else create a clear distinction in your mind between work space and play space so that you don't become a victim of distractions and your productivity doesn't suffer tip number two design for movement a lot of researchers nowadays say that sitting is the new smoking there's evidence that sitting for a very long time and not moving throughout the day can cause an earlier death or at least you know there's a correlation with that I won't go into too many details about that but it's a very very interesting topic so I will leave some links in the description so that you can read about it if you're interested so to avoid all of that design your work space for movement for example get standing desk or one of those standing desks converters that you can put on a normal desk and they will actually function as a standing desk and adjust to your height this will help you stay more active while working and burn more energy and if you want to go one step further you can even get one of those motion boards they're awesome however if you can't get one of these babies make sure you take breaks around every 30 minutes and move around that's what experts recommend there's been research saying that these short active breaks and actually help improve your mood decrease the signs of fatigue affect your appetite and also affect your productivity and it may not make sense right if you're active your circulation is better and therefore more oxygen goes to your brain so you know win-win situation again all the articles about the research that I've mentioned are in the description so there's your further reading if you want but the conclusion is if you want to be more productive at your workspace design it for movement tip number three decorate and customize your space create a space that you love and that you would want to go back to because at the end of the day you will spend quite a lot of time there make sure that it reflects your personality the nature of you work and gives you room to be inspired and creative and here's some of the ways in which you can do that get a plant or multiple like I did spice up your stationery go crazy with those pens and sticky notes put some personal photos up get a nice lamp or you can also get a dream board I've actually read about this in one of the articles when I was preparing to make this video and it's such an awesome idea it's basically like a Pinterest board of all of your dreams because when you can visualize it I guess you're a step closer to achieving them because you are much more intentional about what you do so I love that tip and actually I'm going to create one over there again this should be a place that makes you feel productive customize it as much as you can to save time and also to make it a place where you do like to work make sure that you have all the stationery that you are going to use easily accessible also adjust the heights of your monitor desk chair so that you have the right posture so that at the end of the day your back isn't hurting for example my desk is programmable so I can make it remember the different heights that I normally use so when I'm sitting it's one height and then when I'm standing it's another height and it can adjust automatically and if you want to see how I've programmed it check out my video on Instagram TV the link will be in the description as well this is probably my favorite tip because I have recently discovered that I love decorating you see I've never lived in a flat for long enough to actually decorate it so this was my first experience actually planning things out and arranging them in a way that I liked and it was so much fun it's not finished yet it's not 100% done yet but it's getting closer and it just makes me so happy looking at it and I do want to go back you know this is what you should create for yourself a place where you do want to go back because it just inspires you and you're so happy that it exists and if you guys got inspired by my setup and would like to check out some of the items that I have here I will leave the links to all of them in the description number 4 lighting we have already spoken about you getting a lamp as decoration but proper lighting is vital to your productivity and if you can be close to a window and get some of that gorgeous natural light do that because there are studies that show that it really affects productivity studies have shown that being exposed to natural light helps your brain and your body synchronize and therefore affects your circadian circadian rhythm circadian rhythm and having that in sync helps you sleep better and therefore makes you more alert productive and happy this is crazy but research shows that people who are exposed to natural light throughout the week are not only more inspired to exercise but also get on average 46 minutes more of sleep per night compared to their colleagues who are not exposed to natural lighting again if you're interested in the topic I will leave all links to my research in the description so if you can make sure that your workspace is close to a window so that you're getting natural light and if you can't do that make sure you take regular breaks and go outside for a walk to get that natural light and also get your blood flowing and that goes nicely with the movement tip another thing that you can do is get one of those smart daylight lamps I've been super impressed by the amount of research on lighting and productivity especially by charts like this one from online MBA which shows you which temperature of light is better for what I will also leave a link to their article in the description so you can check that out as well as you can see from this chart different warmth of light are better for different things and there are lamps that actually have all three of those different modes a great one that I found is also by up of desk and I will leave a link in the description it's also LED so it consumes much less energy overall and is better for the environment and finally but very importantly make sure that your workspace is free from clutter and is organized I don't know about you but I can't be productive when there's a mess around me I get super distracted by everything and end up playing with them or I just switch my attention from different things and therefore from different tasks and never get into that state of flow or deep work so yes when decorating and customizing your space make sure that things can be easily put away and cleared so that you have that space on your desk and in my mind I almost see that space on your desk as you the spacing your head and you always need mental space to be productive and creative so yes make sure that you clear your desk regularly to clear your mind I hope that you guys have enjoyed my five tips and have found something interesting and actionable that you can do to
