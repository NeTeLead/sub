 hello guys what's up Bogdan here you're sixteen personalities guy I'm gonna do something a little bit different today based on the comments and requests I've been getting from you guys to make a video about my personality type reveal here we go drumroll please my personality type is I don't know I don't know what my personality type is as I've said to some of you already I have taken the test before twice two different kinds of tests some of you have been asking me to record myself taking a test which we're gonna do later but before we do that I want to just give a brief introduction about me taking the test previously the first time I took it was a long time ago when I was 16 for a school assignment where we all had to take the personality test and I got the infj and when I read about it I thought I I felt that this was very accurate but hold on don't get too excited fast forward to about a year and a half ago I met a guy who is now my friend we we started talking about personality types I didn't know anything about it like but but he did and had read a lot about it and so on and he told me that I was an INTP and I said no no I took the test I'm an infj and he said no your 90p the next day I read about the INTP and I just felt this was so accurate and so correct like they were inside my head you know as I'm sure a lot of you have felt and then after reading the INTP I decided to take the test again which I did and I got the infj as I was reading about the infj I felt that it was not as accurate as the INTP so ultimately I trusted my friend the guy who told me that I was an INTP more than taking an online test I've had multiple times it's happened where my friends have taken the test and they come up to me and say hey look this this is what I got and I say nope that's just wrong I mean it's I've heard before the first step into finding out which personality type you are is to take the test and see which one you're not I think it's correct if there's a person who's very intuitive and knows a lot about the personality types if they can tell if they tell you what you are I think that's much more accurate than taking a test after reading about the infj and the INTP I decided to read about all of them and that's how I began to study personality types and all that another one that I really thought was accurate to me was I STP you know well know INFP is also one as I was reading I felt that this was just so accurate and I felt that it was more true about me than the others and so for a long time I thought that I was INFP maybe that's what I am long story short I don't know what I am I don't think that one can know oneself who they are but by going in and trying to figure out who you are there's a lot of bias there you're only seeing from one perspective from your perspective and so I think it's much more accurate if there is a person out there very intuitive who can tell who can look at you and say oh this is what you are so without further ado let's go take the test. ok so I am here at the 16 personalities website I I just decided to go with this one I'm just just for the fun of it let's just let's take the test here and so you guys can see I guess what's what's in my mind the first question is you find it difficult to introduce yourself to other people mm-hmm not really I never really had a problem with introducing myself so I'm just I'll just click this one right here you often get so lost in thoughts that you ignore or forget your surroundings I do get lost in my thoughts but I'm very self aware I'm kind of neurotic not as much as I used to be so I can be thinking about something and be lost in thought but as soon as some something pops up that needs attention I immediately turn to it and strongly disagree you try to respond to your emails as soon as possible and cannot stand a messy inbox I cannot stand a messy inbox I try to keep my email very organized well anything really organized but I don't respond to emails as soon as possible this one right here mildly agree you find it easy to stay relaxed even when there is some pressure recently this has been easier to do to stay relaxed when there is more and more pressure so I guess I would say yes I do you do not usually initiate conversations my whole life I have never been a conversation initiator never but recently yes I have it's been easier to just sort of walk up to people I've been developing more of my extroverted enos I'm gonna go with this one you rarely do something just out of sheer curiosity yeah that's true I don't like to do things just out of you know let's see what will happen I kind of like to have a reason but there is also a a spontaneity which I enjoy and impulsivity to a certain degree let's do this one next I honestly don't know if I'm answering honestly or not let's see I'm trying to you feel superior to other people what some I'm just gonna be honest here and go with that one because I do kind of feel superior to other people it's a flaw it's um it's something wrong definitely but just inside there's that you know pride in that ego if I'm gonna be honest here then I'm just gonna go with that one I don't like it and I'm working on it being organized is more important to you than being adaptable mm-hmm no adaptable is more important to me you are usually highly motivated and energetic not not really it really depends on what it is which I you know I think goes for all of us but not usually I'm not too energetic or highly motivated about a lot of things I think it's that introverted miss no winning a debate matters less to you than making sure no one gets upset I do like winning my debates and being right that could be a thinking trait I'm gonna go with strongly disagree you often feel as if you have to justify yourself to other people at the end of the day I feel like you know I don't have to explain myself to people I'm gonna go with this one right here because there are times when you do have to justify yourself I think your home and work environments are quite tidy yes I try to stay very organized I'm kind of a clean freak I like to stay very clean and organized you do not mind being at the center of attention I do not mind being at the center of attention I like attention so you consider yourself more practical than creative no it is often difficult for you to relate to other people's feelings no I feel like I relate very strongly to other people's feelings but I just oftentimes I don't really know how to deal with people's feelings sorry my dog is walking around here so you might hear his claw sounds your mood can change very quickly I'm gonna go with this one right here my mood can change very easily but it's just one of the things that I try really hard and to control to not let that happen to to stay more stable next in a discussion truth should be more important than people's sensitive sensitivities yeah I I think that's very true truth should be more important so I very strongly agree you rarely worry about how your actions affect other people and that's not true I do worry about how my actions affect others a lot I think that's how I've spent most of my life probably an interesting book or a video game is often better than a social event as a kid I would immediately go to the strongly agree an interesting book would have been way better to me than a social event very introverted I was a bookworm and social events were not my thing my introverted side does prefer kind of a quiet moment alone to myself being by myself rather than social events you rarely get carried away by fantasies and ideas. nope I do get carried away by fantasies and ideas you often find yourself lost in thought when you are walking in nature I would agree on a work in work going on a walk in a park there you go in nature or a hike make me get lost in thoughts and thinking about life actually I'm just gonna change it as a parent you would rather see your child grow up kind than smart now see this is the question or one of the questions where they determine whether you're a feeling trait or a thinking trait because the feeling trait will say kind right because that's that's feeling the morals and values and principles things like that whereas the thinking trait is going to say smart and shrewd intelligent I'm a Christian and so what if there's a Christian person who immediately changes their mind and says mmm but it's important them to but it's more important to be kind and compassionate things like that right so they kind of go against their immediate response that you have a thinking trait that is being typed as a feeling trait but that's because of certain things in their lives right and so that may be one of the flaws to me it is but for me I will say I'm gonna go with this one right here you do not let other people influence your actions you know I I try to not be influenced by those around me other people try to be very original we're always influenced by those around us by people I've always been a person that that would try to resist other people influencing me things like that so let's do that one when you sleep your dreams tend to focus on the real world and it's events nobody do not my dreams are pretty crazy your emotions control you more than you control them I would disagree I've always tried to emotions and the control that they can have over you very strongly so I'm gonna go with this one right here you often spend time exploring unrealistic and impractical yet intriguing ideas oh yes I do like my intriguing ideas you would rather improvise than spend time coming up with a detailed plan once again kind of depends on the situation really I am moving closer to the improvisation of life going with the flow I'll do that you are a relatively reserved and quiet person yeah I would say so if you had a business you would find it very difficult to fire loyal but underperforming employees I think I would yeah this is something that I think I would have a lot of trouble with you often contemplate the reasons for human existence I do if your friend is sad about something you are more likely to offer emotional support and suggest ways to deal with the problem you know I would always my whole life I would always be suggesting ways to deal with the problem and being mr. practical and stuff but lately it's kind of been more of just offering emotional support and saying it's okay what's going on and just listening but I think I'll have to go with this one right here you rarely feel insecure I feel insecure quite a lot one of the things that I try to battle being right is more important than being cooperative when it comes to teamwork well when it comes to teamwork it's important to be cooperative instead of being correct I would disagree but sometimes when a person's right they're right and the team members should recognize that you think that everyone's views should be respected regardless of whether they are supported by facts or not I do think that everyone's view should be respected obviously but there is a point where you do need to kind of have a basis which I respect from someone who can offer this is why I believe this here are the facts I'm gonna go with you feel more energetic after spending time with the group of people obviously depends on the group of people but I'm have to go with this one right here because I think more quickly than others I will feel the need to kind of be by myself and re-energize by going in and being alone you frequently misplace your things yes and no I do kind of have this problem where I just I'm holding something but then something else comes up and I just kind of set that thing down and completely forget where I left it but as a general everything that I have I do like to know exactly where it is and I in my mind I know exactly where it is so not this one you see yourself as very emotionally stable I do think that I'm pretty emotionally stable inside my emotions are kind of all over the place but I tried to keep it stable so I think I'm gonna do this one your mind is always buzzing with unexplored ideas and plans yes I'm have to strongly agree there you would not call yourself a dreamer I would call myself a dreamer I am a dreamer you worry too much about what other people think I do kind of worry what people think but not too much not to a great extent if the room is full you stay closer to the walls avoiding the center yeah that's true it's that introverted miss again you feel very anxious in stressful situations yes you believe that it is more rewarding to be liked by others than to be powerful agree let's do that one you have always been interested in unconventional and ambiguous things in books art or movies yes I would strongly agree as I'm sure a lot of you can tell you often take initiative in social situations not really but sometimes it's weird okay let's see my results what is this infp Wow oh and an assertive INFP look at that yeah I don't know but but I do think that this could be very true hopefully this answers some questions for a lot of you out there who were wondering not necessarily the result but me answering the questions and talking about myself I hope you liked it thanks for watching please like and subscribe and we'll see you next time [Music]
