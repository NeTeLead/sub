 hi I'm Kate Roy welcome to my channel at the beginning of this year I uploaded a video called 17 goals for 2017 as a type of New Year's resolution / birthday resolutions video and today I thought that I would reflect on those goals that I had made at the beginning of the year and see how I did get a master's degree check I have several videos on my channel about my master's program and my dissertation and all of that so I will leave a link to that playlist up here if you're interested read the Bible everyday I failed this halfway through I was using the Bible app and they have different plans on there to help you read through the Bible in a year or read through like certain themes in the Bible so I was following that but I kind of stopped in the summer and then it yeah once you stop is really hard to start up again but maybe maybe this year or maybe next year 2018 will be the year travel to five countries I have never been to before I think I accomplished not five but most of it I went to Croatia Slovenia Portugal all for the first time I also went to Scotland for the first time and I know it's part of the UK but it is separate from England in a way and then I went to the Netherlands which I have been to before because I went to Amsterdam for like a layover between busses so I was only there for a couple of hours but this year I was there for three days so I think I will count that because that was the first time I properly went and visited go bungee jumping I did not go bungee jumping this year we had planned to maybe go ziplining in Croatia but that ended up not working in our schedule and yeah I said never ended up going bungee jumping I don't know if I will have an opportunity to in 2018 and I don't know if I really want to anymore I keep going back and forth between wanting to do it and then feeling scared about it so we'll see take active steps to overcome worrying somewhat this is always just a struggle for me but the way that I get phases of feeling really worried is just reminding myself that all the other previous times that I had these similar kinds of worries everything turned out to be okay and actually not just okay usually it turns out better than I could have wanted or expected so I remind myself of that and that helps me to stop focusing in on little details not worrying me so much cook a three-course plant-based meal for my friends or family I did not do this I did cook a Thanksgiving meal for my family but that was obviously not vegan even though I could have tried to make it vegan and I have cooked vegan single course meals for my family but I have yet to cook a three-course meal that is all plant-based raised money for a charity I also did not do this one I feel like I didn't do a lot of these but maybe for my birthday coming up next month if I find something that resonates with me maybe I'll do if I don't want to just do any old charity I want to make sure it's something that I really am passionate about watch three musicals or plays I did do this I saw lots and lots of performances while I was in London I took advantage of their like lottery and day seats systems for some of the shows that are going on over there so I saw The Kite Runner and I did like add a seat thing for that I lined up early in the morning and then bought two tickets for like 20 pounds each but they were front-row Center so that was really cool I saw the Curious Incident of the dog in the night-time and that one I also got desi tickets I saw Leigh miserab twice I saw Harry Potter and the cursed child which was I can't wait to watch it again in New York if I get the opportunity and I also saw the Book of Mormon visit or revisit a museum each month I don't think I went to a museum every month in London but I did like go quite often like I've been to the Tate Modern many many times because it's someone near my dorm that I lived in and I would also take a lot of friends to Borough Market and then they're just walk to the Tate Modern because it's a really easy walk so I've gotten there a bunch of times I've been to the National Gallery a bunch of times also been to the Design Museum Victoria and Albert the Wellcome collection and maybe a couple others but definitely didn't go every single month but I think I made up for it wander around London without GPS for one day I didn't do like a dedicated day without GPS but I did get to a point where I could get around not just to like really familiar places but just like get around London without needing to pull out my google maps or anything I did like use city mapper to see like when the buses would be coming but in general I got to the point where I could go around without needing navigation all the time so I didn't do it for a whole day but I think I became familiar enough with the city to get her around on my own stop checking social media first thing in the morning definitely did it do that take a kickboxing class no I still want to do that donate blood for the first time I still have not donated blood maybe maybe this year will finally be the year it was kind of tricky to like try to donate blood while I was in England now that I am settled back in the States maybe I will try to do that write a song I haven't like written a whole song I do have this song that I've been working on that is about Paris and has just this like light you know Parisian feel to it but I don't have a bridge or yet I just have like a couple verses and the chorus but yeah maybe maybe one day soon I will be able to share that one exercise four times a week so I did do this for the first like quarter of the year while I was still going to swim training and stuff when it was still the swim season but once it was like spring break and on the summer I lost any sort of exercise routine I went running for the first time in like seven months on Thanksgiving Day so yeah that's where I'm at with exercising take extra time to moisturize this is like the kind of weird one but I have really dry skin I did kind of start moisturizing more often I started using this body shop soothing aloe gel that is supposed to be good for dry skin so I've been trying to use that more often and I do think it's helping and my last goal of 2017 was not to stress out if I'm not meeting every single goal and I think I met that goal because this is the first time I'm really revisiting my goals since I made that video I think I think I did okay I guess I will probably make another list of goals that I want to achieve in 2018 it's gonna be a big year because I am moving away from LA stay tuned to find out later where I'm moving and why I'll probably do some sort of update but for now that is it for this video I hope you enjoyed let me know in the comments below if you have achieved any or all of your goals from 2017 and I will see you in tomorrow's video bye [Music].
