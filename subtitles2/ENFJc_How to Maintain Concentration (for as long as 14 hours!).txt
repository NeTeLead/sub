 hello it's Ruby and today I'm going to be talking to you about how you can concentrate for longer periods of time so two years ago I posted a 14-hour study with me which has so far got something like 2 million views it's my most popular video on my channel and the question which I got most frequently on that video and which I've got at least once on every video that followed it is how did I manage to study for that long how did I manage to study for such long periods of time and still work productively so I wanted to talk to you about how I was able to do that and how I am able to concentrate for such a long periods of time um so one disclaimer just to point out before I start is that by making this video I'm not recommending that you do 14 hour 15 hour study days and these these tips can be applied to anything which you need to concentrate for long periods of time on so that's not necessarily just school and it might not be that you need to concentrate for fourteen or fifteen hours it might be that you need to concentrate for two hours or one or without getting distracted another thing to point out is that I actually don't study for that long anymore so when I was in sixth form I studied for a long long long periods of time 1415 hours I don't do that at all anymore that's just because I wanted to focus more time on other things but nonetheless I have done long long study days in the past and these are the tips that worked for me so hopefully this video is going to be helpful once again just to stress I'm not trying to advise you on doing 1415 hours I don't do that anymore as I said you can succeed perfectly well without doing it if you'd like me to do a video which is reflective on me doing 1415 hours study days and please let me know ok so studying for long periods of time comes down to four things motivation avoiding procrastination and flow so motivation avoiding procrastination and flow or components of focus first thing that I'm going to point out is motivation so motivation is so important motivation is what will keep you going when you're studying motivation is what's gonna stop you from putting down your books after an hour or two hours it's gonna allow you to work for a much longer period of time so I recently read a really great book which was the motivation myth by Jeff seeded and the quote which sticks with me the most from this book it's one that he uses time and time again success leads to motivation leads to success leads to motivation so accomplishing something is the only way of being motivated that's how we motivate ourselves and so if we're going to feel motivating and walking and continue working for a long period of time then we need to keep up that level of success we need to have small successes which are going to help us to continue the way that I manage to get around this is by using to-do lists this is why I'm such a massive fan of to-do lists so if I have a massive task I will break it up into smaller to do this so if I need to write an essay I will break it up into paragraph one and paragraph to paragraph three conclusion and then I can tick these boxes as I'm going through and I'm accomplishing these small things but it really just keeps your motivation keeps your stamina keeps your momentum up another thing which can help with motivation is make it manageable you can't set like 80 tasks for you to do in one day each of which is going to take you an hour because that's impossible and that's going to be demotivating when you look at it you want to be ambitious do be ambitious but don't overestimate how much you can do that's going to inhibit how much success you feel and then the final thing that I can recommend on the motivation front is timetables so if you are making good headway and you continue going through and taking off at the right pace that you've set for yourself already so you know 9:00 till 10:00 I'm going to write a philosophy essay if you're sticking to the pace that you planned for you to stick out that is a success and I found that that led to motivation so timetables also come in to avoiding procrastination so I will make a timetable which is very strict it helps to regulate my study session of my time making sure that I don't procrastinate and I don't give myself those empty minutes where I can go on my phone without it being scheduled you know that you're going to want to watch YouTube videos you can put that into your timetable there's thing wrong with that this just helps to keep up that momentum again so you just keep on going and you don't really have reason to procrastinate because everything's already planned out for you some really interesting psychology on the idea of choices and when we have a choice to do something if you eliminate choice from your routine you don't have the option to procrastinate and so you're less likely to it's when you have the choice of whether you're going to go ahead with doing this essay or going on your phone the or more likely to go on your phone but if you don't give yourself that choice then you're not going to go on your phone okay now we're going to go into flow which is the most important thing when it comes to studying for long hours or doing anything for long hours so in Camille Preston's that create more flow she says more time and flow means feeling great and creating great things flow is that state where you are content in what you are doing you are completely focused you are completely invested and it's quite a difficult state to get into sometimes but I think that through the motivation and avoiding procrastination we can get into this state for me it was always about finding flow if I didn't have flow there was no way that I was going to be able to sit down and study for that long one component of this for me was feeling relaxed if I felt stressed I would never be able to study for that long things began around in my mind I wouldn't be able to commit myself and focus my time focus my mind entirely on on the task at hand the thing that I would always recommend is making sure that you are relaxed when you start studying and that is a video that's actually something I've spoken about a bit in my video how to enjoy studying where I talk about how I manage to get into this state so do you go check that out because I don't want to repeat myself later okay so then a few other bits that I want to focus on so another thing that I would do which would help me to keep walking for long periods of time would be to switch between activities and this doesn't really work for everyone like I've had some people say that this isn't isn't a very effective strategy but it really really works for me because it prevents me from getting bored with anything so you commit you commit to something you are entirely focused but it's natural that eventually you're going to start to think okay this is getting a bit samey say me I want I want some change so what I would do is I would schedule my study sessions so that I go between subjects I go from chemistry to Spanish to English rs and I just fluctuate between them so it's not only with the subject so so I would fluctuate between passive and active revision and most importantly I go between learning new things and revising old things I'm like I love learning I really love learning and the part that I was found most tedious the pot I still find most tedious about studying is the fact that you've got to spend so much time going over things you already know and I like it when you're when you're giving yourself new opportunities to analyze or reflect or you know widen your horizons with relation to a particular piece of work sometimes it can be not not necessarily passive but it's just about regurgitating and that's not something I enjoy I don't enjoy memorizing but I really really love when I'm able to add something new in and do some research so I would actually a lot between going over flashcards and then adding to my flashcards or reading some extension essay and it really helped me to sustain my motivation throughout another thing which can be helpful is to have a motivational method / routine so if you're not feeling motivated this is something that you can fall back on and I've actually got an example on my channel because I have my own motivational routine which I do follow if I'm not getting motivated another thing that I really recommend is to keep goals and also keep in mind the intrinsic worth of what you are doing so this whole premise of enjoying studying comes down to something which is known as the Sawyer effect which I will leave more information about below and please let me know if you want me to do a video talking about this in more depth but basically this lawyer of fact says that we can turn anything into play so we can turn work into play in the same way that Tom Sawyer pretends the painting the fans which is work is something really fun and really enjoyable and we can do that with anything and I really think we can do is studying if we commit to doing that in my experience that's really the best way to optimize flow because otherwise you're so focused on reward and you're so focused about on what comes now yes so I hope that this video was helpful I know it was quite rambling it's quite long and I was quite a lot of content too but nonetheless I hope that it was helpful and I hope that it helps you to sustain concentration motive a when you're studying or doing any sort of work tasks that does require a great degree of focus so thank you for watching and I hope that you have a productive week
