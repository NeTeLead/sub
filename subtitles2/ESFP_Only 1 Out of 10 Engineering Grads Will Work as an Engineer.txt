 hey my name's Matt and I make realistic career videos and today we're gonna talk about why only 1 out of 10 people who graduate with a mechanical engineering degree will ever work as a mechanical engineer when I started my channel seven years ago I was really Pro engineering and so I made a lot of videos that talked about engineering as a career and at the time I was interning at SoCal gas at a very high-paying internship and I thought oh after I get a full-time job it's gonna become really interesting but my internship was really boring but what I discovered was all my engineering jobs were boring and so I started making a lot of videos talking about how boring my jobs are but also how hard it is to get a job as a mechanical engineer so a couple years ago I turned anti engineering I pivoted my channel basically and a lot of people got mad at me I got a ton I got ton of personal insults you know people call him dumb people calling me lazy people call me at entitled millennial and it's funny because out of all these people throwing insults to meet you when I'm just gonna I'm actually gonna reveal some data in this video but mostly people throwing insults to me they're studying engineering and they will never work as an engineer and that's because there are thirty thousand people graduating with a mechanical engineering degree and only 2,500 mechanical engineering jobs opening up now let me distinguish technology jobs and engineering jobs technology jobs are things like software development software engineering web development data signs VR I encourage people to go into technology I discourage people from going into engineering mechanical aerospace chemical civil the physical types of engineering and so when you look at the data for every job opening there are ten mechanical engineering grads so what do you think are going to happen there's this not enough jobs available for the 30,000 people graduating each year with a mechanical engineering degree now whenever I present data like this which I talked about it even a couple years ago people get so mad at me and they throw a ton of personal insults but ask yourself are you really being an engineer if you can't just look at the data and do some basic analysis like okay 30,000 here who graduate degrees and then 2,500 job openings if you're gonna be engineer you got to be logical efficient and unbiased to the data and that's just the data so you can throw all the personal insults you want toward me but that still doesn't change the data and honestly saying one out of ten mechanical engineering grads will ever get a job as a mechanical engineer is being generous because if you think about it in 2017 there's 30,000 people that graduated with a mechanical engineer you will say 5000 of them got jobs welcomes 2018 those 25,000 still need a job and there's an additional 30,000 people in 2018 are already graduated with a mechanical engineering degree so that makes 55,000 people competing for 2,000 3,000 or 4,000 mechanical engineering job openings people love to stroke their own egos whenever they have an opportunity so whenever I say things like this I get people without writing my comments on youtube or on my Instagram that they'll say something like this well I graduated from Georgia Tech summa wad and my first job was at land rover they're paying me a hundred thousand and if you can't do the same you're lazy and and dumb that's exactly how I read your comments when when you write something like that so to the people that say things like that I have two things to say to you number one you're a jackass and nobody likes you number two you're still at a middle-class job going to an office Monday through Friday and getting paid less 30% less than a comparable software developer so you're successful but you're not that successful also whenever I met comedic like this I'm gonna get a flood of comments emails and messages essentially saying well Matt what do I do I'm in my third year fourth year of mechanical engineering and I can't switch out now and I'm several thousand dollars in debt what do I do so the first thing I'm gonna say is something that's gonna sting and then the second thing I will say is something that's helpful so first is that you could easily look this up before you study mechanical engineering it took me 15 minutes to find this information and also I've been making videos that are anti engineering for several years now and you didn't want to take my advice before so you put yourself in that situation and also that's one of the reason why I'm so passionate about making these kind of videos is because it saves people thousands of dollars and years or their life second thing I'll say is something helpful you can finish your mechanical engineering degree and see if you can get a job that you like because even though I'm very anti engineering there are several engineers out there who like their job but if you can't get a job switch to technology do something like web development data science because honestly it doesn't take four years of your life and $50,000 to earn $80,000 you can easily go to a coding boot camp or a data science boot camp and then just graduate and then rather bad you'll be earning like 60 or 80 thousand dollars depends on your your skill level and where you're from but really in three or six months with some trade school type training you can have a very respectable salary so the idea that you have to go to four years or five years of school bachelor's degree to get an $80,000 starting salary it's just not necessary then the last thing I got to say is a little bit of Matt Tran philosophy that when you choose a skill or career choose something that a lot of companies need so on this channel you'll see me talk a lot about web development or about digital marketing because how many companies need a website a lot of them and yeah there are services like WordPress and Shopify that make websites for a lot of companies where they don't need a developer but any company that needs some functionality they need a web app and that has to be created by a web developer so that's why there are 50,000 software engineering jobs available compared to only 6,000 for mechanical engineers I also encourage people to do digital marketing because digital marketing is selling things on the internet through paid traffic organic traffic and how many companies out there need to sell their stuff online it's like every company so the demand is insane for digital marketers and so if you want to learn more about different careers I have several playlists on my channel page that you can check out and if want to ask me a question I actually do need more questions
