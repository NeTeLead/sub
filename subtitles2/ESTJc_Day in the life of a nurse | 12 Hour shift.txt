 that 5:00 a.m. wake-up is so real but today I'm gonna take you through a day in my life as a nurse when I'm working eight day shift honestly I wake up at the last moment possible which usually means around 6:00 because I start my shift at 7:00 but I live really close to the hospital thankfully obviously the first thing I do is brush my teeth and just put my hair up so that I can get ready for the day I always wash my face in the morning this makes me feel really refreshed and just kind of wakes me up puts me in a way better mood after that I usually head on over to the kitchen and I have a very large glass of water I've been doing this since middle school I also have some vitamins as well as some fiber gummies fiber gummies just ya know keep the bowels movin gotta practice what you preach and of course I am scrolling my phone and going through Instagram in the morning I always try to go back on my recent posts and reply to all the comments because I know you guys take the time out of your day to message me something so I always do my best to respond I normally suck at packing my lunch because you got to cook that beforehand but breakfast I do always pack since I'm not trying to spend 24 million dollars at the hospital cafeteria my breakfast usually is yogurt or bananas or cereal or something of that sort next we have a mini skincare routine I start out with the Innisfree green tea mist which just hydrates your skin I promise it's not hairspray after that we have the green tea moisturizer which is also one of my favorites if you can't already tell I love Innisfree but unfortunately this is not sponsored by them my makeup routine is pretty much very minimal because my priority is just getting to work on time I don't really care what I look like some lip balm is definitely essential because who knows when the next time you'll be able to drink water is and then in terms of actual makeup I usually just fill in my brows which I used the Anastasia brow is and on a good day I will also put on some concealer and cover up all the acne I have from lack of sleep as well as just line my lips and then haircare I just sprayed to tangler before I comb it through in efforts not to lose you know 3/4 of my hair when I comb it out I don't know why this is so overexposed but let's go through what I bring you definitely bring my multicolored pen I got this from Muji it has six different colors my earpods I always listen to music on my way to where it kind of just sets the mood for the day lip balm my keys obviously so I don't get locked out fun fact I forgot my keys many times my badge so that I can get into the bedroom some gum for that stinky breath clearly I only have a piece left lots of snacks lots of lots of snacks you're gonna need it and an iPhone charger my final check of items I need before I leave or my iPhone my hair band and my iwatch and let's definitely not forget my water bottle because when I forget it I ended up not drinking water the whole day and it's kind of a mess okay I'm just popping in my ear pods I always like to listen to music like I said before my shift usually something upbeat so that puts me in a good mood to you know deal with people for our 12 hours at a time in terms of shoes there's basically two options that I go with one of them is my Nike Free Runs and the other one are can't go clogs normally for day shifts I like to wear clogs so let's go with those. all right let's get to work. our lovely Hospital elevator has a nice reflection so that you can see how bad you look in the morning before you head into work this morning apparently I'm feeling particularly happy so once I get in first thing I do is put my breakfast in the fridge and then also definitely need to fill up my water bottle I bring it empty coz I walk to work and it's super heavy to bring a filled water bottle so I just do it at work I always try to finish this entire bottle by the time I finish work and usually I get through about a bottle and a half after that I get hand off report from the nurse it usually happens between 7:00 to 7:30 but the morning is really really busy it's concentrated on passing a lot of medications doing a lot of Education rounding things like that as a nurse I am calling a lot of people all the time whether it's the resident the fellow nutrition a consult PT ot I spend a lot of time on the phone finally it's breakfast time for my hospital I usually get a 15-minute break for breakfast in the morning on this sad day the yoghurt that I had brought had somehow expired or something happened basically it was purely liquid and so thank goodness there was spare cereal on the unit I'd actually never had these before but they were so freakin delicious ten out of ten would definitely go by and have more next time also I'm eating it with a fork and I'm Loki lactose-intolerant which is why there is no milk my day consists of a lot of charting so I'm just catching up on that I usually like to take my lunch break around 3 or 4 p.m. sometimes 2 p.m. if I'm feeling a little bit hungry ER today I forgot to pack lunch actually I did almost never pack lunch because I'm lazy so just bought food from the cafeteria and I always like to sit outside sitting outside just you know it's a breath of fresh air and a nice break feels like you're actually taking a break and stepping away from the hospital but here's some pasta hummus and meatballs was actually pretty good now that I've successfully food coma myself it is now time to head back upstairs and go back to work I'm honestly shook it's because I was not expecting this but this is literally the first time this has happened to me in the one year that I worked here okay this is actually crazy it is currently I think like 3 p.m. it's 3:30 p.m. and I am back home I have literally never ever ever been sent home early and of course the one day that I decide to vlog a day my life is the one day that I get sent home early but it actually it happened I feel like decently often just has never happened to me but in the ICU essentially what happens is during the day oftentimes patients are transferred out and if you have two patients that are hot up that two different nurses had then the two patients will be combined and one nurse will take the full assignment while the other nurse is sent home so I was a nurse who was sent home and it is actually a Sunday afternoon so I'll take it I don't mind but I am back tomorrow and I won't have that assignment back which is kind of a bummer but I guess it's not too bad all of a sudden I have an extra what all of a sudden I have an extra like six hours to my day so this will be nice okay I'm gonna do the honors and take some oil blotting sheets and just show you in 8 hours exactly what accumulates on my face like I can literally feel it and I usually bring these to work with me because it gets crazy and when I have a moment I just tried to you know refresh not Gail oh my goodness very easily grossed out don't watch this here's what they look like pretty crazy it's a lot of oil on my skin so if you're wondering why break out after you work it's because there's so much oil that collects on your skin and of course naturally I hopped in the shower so that I can cleanse myself after this long shift okay guys update time I take a shower I always do after shift you make your payments on an isolationist feel like being in the hospital but as usual I ordered some takeout today I got some buff I'm usually pretty good about cooking and not eating out when I am not working and what I'm staying at home I feel like I don't deserve this because I only worked eight hours today but takeout in it is so we also got some fries I probably will finish this it'll all be over a couple of days but honestly I'm pretty tired I almost like don't even know how I survived for 12 hours my first ever 12-hour shift in nursing school so we started at 6:30 only ending at 6:30 but post-conference starts at I think 4:30 so it's like a two-hour post conference and literally in the post conference I fell asleep and so many of my classmates also fell asleep our clinical instructor didn't even say anything because she felt so bad for us and she knew how tired we were now you do as well as all this one so you live and you learn but I'm honestly probably going to eat this and take a little hop cuz I'm tired and then hopefully we'll get a little workout in so we have so much time left today. I would still be at work during this time it's like seven something I am so glad that base that me early because honestly I'm freakin exhausted once I got home I at dinner dinner and then I legit took a two-hour nap and just woke up and it's literally like it looks so gloomy but it's like 85 degrees out it's a lot cooler outside than it is in my apartment so I thought I'd just kick it for a quick run and get pumped for my shift tomorrow because I'm back it's so weird like actually having time after my shift normally I got home at like 7:30 or 8:00 eat dinner take a shower and pass out so definitely had a little bit more time to squeeze in a workout and stuff and I pretty much stopped blogging there at this point I probably went home I think I took another shower and then I went to bed to get ready for the shift tomorrow so I hope you enjoyed this video it was kind of an atypical day but hope it gives you a little bit of insight as to how all my life is if you like this video please be sure to give it a big thumbs up and like and subscribe and I'll be back next week with another video [Music]
