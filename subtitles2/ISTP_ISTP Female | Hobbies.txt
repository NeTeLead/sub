 hello so I am a nice teepee and I just wanted to make a video about my hobbies because they're a big part of my life and there's really important to me so I've noticed that there's not a lot of content out there about is teepees and most of it is actually geared towards male is teepees so I thought it would just be helpful for everyone to have an example of what a female eyes to be enjoys doing so I want to share this because I think that the more data that's out there on is teepees the easier will be for people to set aside some of these really surface level stereotypes and begin to really understand the mindset that really drives the ice teepee so obviously I'm only sharing my experience I don't know that everything that drives me is universal among is teepees but the best I can do is share my perspective and hope that there's other ice teepees out there or anyone else has any insights to add so that my experiences can be compared with yours and we can come to a better understanding of who I stays really are so before I start I first wanted to say that there's a lot of stuff out there about ICPs being daredevils and really into like high adrenaline risky activities and sports and that is not a tallboy I'm actually a super safe person but I'm not really gonna get into that right now because that could be a whole other video and so I'm just gonna gloss over that but just know that I'm kind of setting that aside right now I'm just gonna focus on the things that I do enjoy doing so all of the hobbies that I have or at least most of the hobbies that I have are very driven by infrared thinking and extroverted sensing and kind of those both working together so I say X Rho says he is the most immediately obvious because what I like to do is usually hands-on where expert sensing is less obvious is how it helps me observe what's in front of me um then I take those observations the data I gather from that and I use my interpretive thinking to really analyze and understand what's in front of me like what how it works what it's made of and how it could be improved or changed so if I were to describe myself overall I would say that I'm very in tune with the nuance in the physical realm by that I mean like flavor the way things smell the way things feel the way they look I just have heightened awareness of the nuance and that in turn enables me to be a very precise person I would say I'm also very creative more and I like a practical like hands-on like down-to-earth kind of way not if you're an abstract way and somewhat artistic and I have a natural aptitude for learning new hands-on skills there's also a lot of things I enjoy take an interesting that are heavily and we're thinking based and even introverted intuition um but because things that involve expert sense you know I would say are really the things I love the most I'm just going to focus on those hobbies so let's see I would say the first one I'm going to start with because it's something I enjoy doing for like my whole life that I'm still really into is baking now to clarify I don't want to lose any kind of baking I like more creative baking so I don't really enjoy following recipes I find them to be very boring and my plane um I I don't know let's see well why do I like being I guess I love just like combining the ingredients and kind of just using using my analytical skills and applying it to baking like I know what different ingredients to an extent I know how old fact when I'm making until I imagine the outcome that is like desirable and then I start figuring out what I could do to try to achieve that outcome and I also really like mastering like the feel of the batter like the way it looks in the oven in the second it's supposed to come out the way the way it feels like when you touch in the oven um different flavors the combinations the amounts of each like spice the texture that I'm trying to achieve all that kind of stuff I don't know I could just I love to just know it by like the way it smells what it feels and be able to just achieve the best outcome and so for a long time I really just would experiment and I would just create recipes or variations of recipes I've kind of just severe from what was written but then I would never write it down so I could never recreate it in like a year ago or so someone told me no you should really write this things down so that if you like it you can make it again or you can improve it the next time and that was a really great interesting it's not something I'm naturally prone to I normally don't really like writing things down I like to just kind of roll with it and see what happens but doing that has been so good and so helpful and it's been really fun because it allows me to not just like experiment something new but I can actually like do iterations I can see what went wrong and see what I can do better and so that's kind of a fun challenge um so I have like a million things I like to do not a lot of things I've mastered as a but I've taken since like are joining College I've taken quite a few classes to like community college or just in the community in general so the first class that I took upon graduating was welding which is actually really cool also physically exhausting so but I think that's part of the reason why I don't continue with it as much also I don't have the equipment so it's kind of hard to do but for those of you who've never welded before it was very interesting thing to experience the first time because they just kind of show you briefly how to do it and they throw you into this stall and just you just have at it which just seems really dangerous you know but it's okay so the first time I did it you like you know this stick right and you gotta like strike the arc just right and then and then you got to kind of like it slowly gets eaten up as you're going down and you okay so you create the puddle and you pull it but the first time I did it so I strike the arc and then personally you can't see anything cuz you're in this mask and it's completely black so you're blind while you're striking the arc on this metal piece in front of you um and then suddenly like sparks are flying at you it's really loud it's really hot in there sparks flying directly in your face I'm just very alarming when you've never done anything like that before but then once I like stop and just accepted the fact that there is it was gonna be like this crazy work environment then once I accepted that I was able to just like allow with a spark light at me allowed this everything coming at me and just focus in and zero in in front of me and just like watch the puddle until we pull it and like focus on how things felt and what I was seeing and it just ignore everything else around me which was a very incredible experience like I would leave and I'm just a dream not literally dream but like I would just daydream about it because it's really cool so I like that I think is just a really cool skill to learn using I don't know material but I never really built with before and it's useful so I like that um let's see another class I took was archery I think I've always had kind of a fascination with more like guys stuff cuz I don't actually know what arteries from but not as technologically advanced things so like it's something that someone could literally make and build themselves obviously in this archery class I was not easy to homey oh I was but I still really liked it I really like target practice and just focusing on everything that my body was doing and how it was impacting my results um and trying to just every time practicing over and over and over again trying to perfect that and figure out the best way to hit the target I guess and I also so like a lot of people like shooting and like winning gun ranges and stuff I can't say I've ever done it I'm not naturally drawn to the idea I think because it's a very like loud and I don't know it's just. like bombastic is the right word it's just you you just make your presence known when you do that and I don't think that's like what I'm actually drawn to but I really like our tree because it's still requires that saying my precision and accuracy but it's very sleek and subtle which I buy a lot um let's see currently I'm taking a pottery class which is also cool it's just another material to work with to create things in learning like I could go in on the wheel learning the feel of it and and how to change what you're doing in order to achieve right outcome like feeling how it feels and then seeing what happens as a result of that and how can I like slightly change what I'm doing to achieve the outcome that I want and it's also a looser sense of kind of artistry in that to making it look beautiful actually the same was true for welding like I really like trying to make it's really beautiful I've kind of dabbled in some wood burning as well as wood carving and calligraphy I've done actually a decent amount of calligraphy I find those to be extremely peaceful things because it's so slow like wood burning like I would have liquid burn calligraphy actually and so you have to like really just focus so closely on what's in front of you and it kind of takes a while so there's a lot of precision and accuracy involved as well as artistry but I think it really just being so present with like what's in front of me like what it looks like what it feels like what's going on it really helps my mind to slow down and just makes me feel so just like peaceful which lets see what I also I haven't done this in a while but I am I've had some phases where I've been into sewing um so I was so like when I was in high school then even in college I sewed a few of my own purses again kind of like begging like I don't like following the recipe and baking I also didn't like following someone else's pattern we saw mean I think that's just so boring takes all the fun out of it so I would actually come up with the design I wanted and then backtrack and figure out exactly how it needed to be put together like what the pattern I would make create my own pattern figure out exactly the order in which things needed to be assembled in order to not run into issues and have it look the best I guess so yeah that was cool well I've done knitting and crocheting don't want that that one isn't I don't know I don't like it quite as much because it's a little bit more just like routine you just keep doing the same stitch over and over again but it's still peaceful I enjoy doing sometimes another big area of my hobbies actually comes out in music so I was a horn player French horn player which is like this circle instrument it's a brass instrument with the balance you hold like this and I did that all through college actually and so that was a huge obsession of mine actually and I think I had more of an aptitude for accuracy than most other horn players had I was just couldn't stay in anything that wasn't precise in my playing which isn't to say that I was completely precise and everything but like when I wasn't I couldn't stand it you know so I think the fact that it bothered me so much really helped me to eliminate as much of that as I could so I practiced a lot with that I also play a little bit of piano guitar I like to sing oh I also played trumpet through high school so I would say learning an instrument is very like very relatable to introverted thinking x4 it's sensing but there's also a whole nother side of me that I would say music doesn't quite entirely fit into that realm because it's really also a huge avenue of expression for me I also got into dance I actually took a ballet class not because I like ballet that much because ballet is very rigid structured and you have to like follow the rules exactly the way it's supposed to be so I took ballet because I learned that that was the foundation for lyrical dance so lyrical dance is kind of like belly and has a lot of the same techniques but it's just a lot more free-flowing and expressive uhm but I ended up actually like Natalie elected a lot too but I could go into more of the expressive side but I don't really want to do it right now because that would just be a lot maybe I'll make another video sometime about that. yeah I mean it beyond that like I don't really have any other like I can't do giving like wheel hobbies but I pretty much just like at learning any hands-on skill any new technique I love just understanding how things work how machines work I love just taking materials that exist in and seen what I can do to make them into something entirely new or to make them better like I I don't really like solving problems without a budget because if you could buy anything to fix something it just takes all the fun out of it cuz you just buy something that already exists but when you have limited resources that's when like that's when you can really get creative and inventive and you can just take materials that you would never think to use first or a problem and I don't know just somebody totally new oh yeah I guess that's all I can only think of right now if there's any I used to piece out there again or anyone that knows I see peas or anyone that's just really smart and understands people please leave a comment and let me know your thoughts let me know if you've seen this before you find this relatable or what your hobbies are oh thank you
