 let's see focused I am so I forgot what this was light I'm filming by myself today it's been like years since I've done that in fact I am gonna be editing this all by myself which I haven't done in a long time but then I realize I got a new computer and I don't have premiere so I'm gonna be using iMovie remember this stuff stuff we used to do old school YouTube hmm hey guys so just like the title says and I'm sure many of you have already noticed I have been taking a little bit of a break from YouTube and I know that sounds a little bit misleading because I have been posting every week but just the podcast and I have been posting twice a week on higatv but when I say take a break I mean you guys know if you've been on this channel long enough this is not my normal type of type of content and I know I probably should have made this video before I took this little break because that is what normal youtubers do instead of just you know upsetting their subscribers and making them comment like where are you haven't you been posting but do you know me I like to go against the grain and by that I mean go against what you should do in order to maintain your YouTube channel but that's okay because there's still quite a handful of you that are still here and I'm I actually very much so appreciate that very much so a pre I actually very I actually I appreciate you guys and that's why I felt the need to kind of explain myself in this video for those of you that don't know I had been making videos for a long time on YouTube since 2006 about 13 years you know I started in a time where you could not make money off of YouTube and the videos I started off doing a really crappy you know so for me the fun part was always just trying to get better than the last video and just keep improving and draw more fans to you and see what you can do to be better and essentially just make better content because the better your content was I mean the more YouTube would promote it and that kind of just fit with my motto of always wanting to improve and make something better than the last video that was always my goal but in the past five or six years YouTube changed that a lot and maybe it was even earlier than that YouTube's algorithm change and basically it became about watch time so you wanted to make longer videos and you wanted people to be watching them all the way through and for the longest time I tried to fight that system and I always believed that you know you should focus on quality and not quantity even though that the sacrifice you know a whole month of not posting videos which will take a hit on your bun your buns there's no other way to describe that just snorted a little bit but no other way to describe it it would take a hit on your income because you're not posting obviously less people are watching your other videos as well and for me I was actually okay with that because like I said it was never really about the numbers and stuff I just the thing I really cared about was putting out good content and stuff that I was excited and happy to make you know me and the guys were working on it we were happy about it we didn't necessarily care as long as you know a decent amount of use or I could still pay everyone it worked but over time as I kept trying to do that the videos got crazier that times it took to make it got longer I don't know I don't even know when exactly it started to happen but I was subconsciously I think getting a little frustrated with YouTube and getting getting really just bitter I guess with how what what YouTube had become seeing the kind of content that was suddenly at the top of the food chain that I mean I have nothing against you know when all the dish traps and stuff was happening I actually it was one of the people who said I don't blame them at all they're actually doing what's what's what you should be doing for your career that's smart if I was a smart businessperson I probably would have followed that trend I am NOT I go against the grain but anyway I'm getting a little off track essentially to make this long story a little bit shorter I was getting frustrated with the way YouTube had become and I guess I don't know when it started to happen but I started to I had a I got a very bad attitude having the hollows to describe it it happened very slowly like over time like I don't know if you guys know this or not but over the past few years I'm not gonna say every single video but there's a lot of videos in the past few years that I posted that I knew for a fact could have been better it wasn't ready to go out it wasn't something I was proud of and I was not happy about if I wasn't laughing at it it wasn't good to me and I was not laughing it I would see 90% of the videos I posted in the last three years and the finding is the ones I really liked or the ones that didn't do well the ones that I hated did super well just because they were the right topic or because they had the right like the right title or the right thumbnail we're soul encouraging they're like oh my god right this is so brilliant this is so smart I love this oh my god you're the only genuine youtuber or whatever it's not making funny I'm not making fun of you guys I actually really appreciate it all I'm saying is I'm trying to explain that from my perspective I don't know why but I would feel worse because I knew that it wasn't I didn't deserve it I don't know what see I have some psychological issues I don't know what that is and I know like I said it sounds super first world problem problem me I mean it is a first world problem but it's a real it was a problem for me like I said maybe you have mental issues I don't know what it is this is a hard video for me to post I know it's not fun or funny it's not what you're used to but it it's just more of an update and I don't know why I vented this to you guys but I felt like for the few of you that cared this is the reason why the content has changed but again as much as I said I haven't think in a break from YouTube there has been videos that we've been working on if you do is that I actually had fun doing here's a little little preview of some of them coming out I brought back a little bit of cooking but not really oh oh oh do you know no see kids you want to cut the nipple off so they do the longer shows they're hella fast ever watch those videos you're like pretty good yeah I did another ryan tries where i got to paint some similarly kinda like a bob ross type a video just because i always wanted to paint just continue to paint the entire canvas same color it already is there's no mistakes here hopefully gets a little bit lighter it's not instruction across okay that's that's not a happy cloud it's a little angry might have gotten a little bit of black on the brush another big whoops free tree needs a friend there's no trees that have no friends because they would die you can't tell what one color starts and where another one began I can't see it also colorblind we did another trickshot video and that one is not something I mean that's one I gotta thank our old videos but really it's in the arcade so like it wasn't excuse for me to just play in arcade games all day anyway I'm living the life I know I'm sorry I'm having fun making videos again that's my main thing that's why I haven't been posting videos because I'm having fun making them that makes no sense we actually have been working on a crazy video it's about three months in the making stop motion and it's for this right here for a ninja man for ninja mill yes I am still doing this as well go to Walmart comm slash ninja mill I think I'm gonna post that one next actually but anyway I just made this video to update you guys thank you to those of you that are still here watching I have been very afraid to release this video um I actually wanted to release it when I was gonna take the break which was three months ago just kept pushing it back and in the process I saw a lot of you got very frustrated and upset so I want to apologize for that but I yeah at the time I didn't even know I was gonna take a break at the time I was gonna either take a break or quit but I think I finally realized that now that I'm creating different types of content that's not stuff that I hate I don't need to quit I'm I feel good I haven't felt this kind of freedom on this channel since the very beginning of YouTube I would have never posted this video of two years ago just me talking that's not funny it's not creative for those of you that are still watching and are okay with that thank you so much because it trust me it kind of brought me out of a little mini depression and I don't use that word lightly and I know it seems like I'm just complaining about like minuscule things there's a lot bigger problems in the world I know some people can't afford to just because they hate their job they can't just quit their job and do something else you know like I get it but for anyone out there that is in a scenario like this just know that there's a way to get out and you just have to wait for the opportunity and not be afraid it's like jumping into a cold pool you know it day I need a better quote when trying to say is don't let fear stop you from jumping into the pool does that make sense you know cuz the pool would be like the new direction that the analogy is like cuz you're hot right and you know the pool is nice and cold but it's scary to jump into it that transition moment is the scary part so that's the fear that stops you let me rephrase don't let fear I guess I guess the difference in my scenario is some people don't have the luxury of being able to just jump into the pool because they have other responsibilities maybe you have a kid don't let fear stop you from jumping into the pool unless you have a kid to take care of bring the kid in the pool with you but he may drown you because you have to swim for you can jump into the pool if you have really good legs straight also depends Hollywood have to kick in the kids where the kid can stay in the Sun suffering push the kid into the shallow and don't let fear of the kid drowning the kid is on the shallow end of the fear and kids or don't have fear of just orb don't jump don't keep you don't have kids is the lesson so what do you think yeah think I'll keep editing the videos from here
