 so I have this theory that self-discipline begins with giving yourself no other option or at least making it harder for yourself to not engage with the activity I used to be absolutely the worst at any task that required self-discipline going to the gym every day no thanks eating salads every day no thanks waking up early absolutely actually back up I'm still the absolute worst at self-discipline so much so that I've kind of hacked it in a way I found a way around it a different solution so stick with me here it might seem a little bit extreme but I'll try to explain it as best I can if I pack my gym bag at night and I put my toiletries in it they're the only toiletries I own and I put the gym bag in the trunk of my car then in the morning when I wake up I have two choices either go outside in my pajamas to get my gym bag and take out the toiletries so I can take a shower at my apartment before going to work or I can simply get into the car and drive to the gym and shower and brush my teeth there after working out see if you construct things like this so it feels far more challenging to resist the action than to just engage in the action then the self-discipline is just gonna come naturally we probably can all agree that it's way easier to think about doing something or to plan on doing something compared to actually doing the thing so just work on the planning side and let the actually doing it follow seamlessly after because I love taking the path of least resistance that is something I am very good at does that make sense let me give you a few more examples if you don't carry your credit card with you you can't use your credit card if you need to have the ability to buy things when you're out you can limit your spending by using cash if you have no other food in your fridge except for salad then you'll probably end up eating salad if you put your alarm clock across the room from you or even in a separate room so you have to walk to it to turn it off it's much more likely that you'll be to awake at that point to go back to bed and sleep longer hey maybe you can get a couple of different alarm clocks and make them lead you down the hall at consecutive intervals so you're very far from your bed by the time you're done turning them all off focus on planning rituals that make it much harder to resist the activity than to engage with it and the percentage of times that you're going to actually do that self-discipline tasks will automatically increase here's one more example I hate doing laundry but I only own enough clothes for one week I have to do my laundry every Sunday night or I have nothing to wear to work on Monday morning I have no choice and since I have no choice I have no problem following through with doing my laundry every week the funny thing is that if I tell this to people it sounds like I'm super self disciplined oh she does for laundry every single Sunday at night the same time every week that's amazing super self disciplined but in reality that is the absolute last time of the week that I can do my laundry it is complete procrastination so maybe the secret is to stop trying to white-knuckle yourself through self-discipline and think about it in a different way constructing your paths so that it would be the least resistance to follow through with new activity until next time.
