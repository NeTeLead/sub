 hi everyone i'm angie from psychology tea so you guys have been asking me what's your type I don't mind you see it suckas you this is a comment from Kevin well Kevin guess what we're doing both I'm going to reveal my type and you get to see me to kiss me this time so we're killing two birds with one stone you also asked me the real question is what's your personality type what's your type are you entp so I really like your videos but would be nice to know your type I got the message you guys actually I've taken the MBTI test maybe two or three years ago and I've taken it twice and the first time I got intp then I got infp and boat seems really really accurate so I don't know maybe I haven't taken it seriously a design been thinking about taking it again I was just procrastinating about it noise so I'm going to take it again now and I thought I'll be more serious now that I have a camera in front of me right let's do it so Who am I well I want a person that doesn't like to talk about herself so let's just end this video right I'm just kidding you know there are so many birds. they will participate with me in this video so probably hear them a lot sorry about that I am on the sixteen personalities comes the first result that I got on Google it says free tests takes less than 12 minutes and start honestly even if you don't like the answer well that's a great life advice try not to leave neutral answers yeah basically don't be that guy the first question is you enjoy vibrant social events with lots of people that's a good one strongly disagree if your friend is sad about something your first instinct is to support them emotionally not try to solve their problem okay I will try to find a solution rather than support them emotionally because I think that I would really be there for someone when I do something for them and when I go to someone named sad I would need them to help me find a solution and if I can implement it myself then I would love it if they could help me with that so I will go with mine Lee agree people can rarely upset you know it's pretty easy to upset me actually like this flatterers video right there pretty sure almost I mean there are some details to be worked out sure but the basic concept is sound absolutely sound often rely on other people to be the ones to start a conversation and keep it up I just want to say thank you to all my extroverted friends and more accelerated introverts out there because without you guys have totally be friendless you can stay calm under a lot of pressure I actually suffered from anxiety a lot and I started meditating like four years ago so now I'm just chill I can say call totally it's wrong we agree on this one when in a group of people you don't know you have no problem jumping right into their conversation they're still asking introvert/extrovert questions yeah I'm an introvert I embrace my introversion okay just leave me alone thank you you usually lose interest in a discussion when it gets philosophical actually no I don't to the contrary if a discussion is not philosophical are you making feels of self strongly is it it comes to making life-changing choices you mostly listen to your heart rather than your head this one is tearing me usually oh wait the positive and the negative and I'll try to make an objective and logical decision when it comes to a decision that has to do with someone very close to me then my heart will always find a way I'll go with slightly agree you often make decisions on a whim now I'll father for three years the time you spent by yourself of an ends up being more interesting and satisfying than the time you spend with others well I'm pretty good at entertaining myself yeah strongly agree you often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings actually how to understand your feelings even when you don't understand them himself you often drift away into daydreaming about various ideas or scenarios yeah well usually they dream and even sometimes I'll be talking to someone and I'll be daydreaming and I'll act like I'm listening when I'm not I got pretty good at that you often contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life. [Music]. spending time in a dynamic atmosphere with lots of people around quickly makes you feel drained and in need of a gateway yeah after an hour with a lot of people will quickly be like your personal work style is closer to spontaneous bursts of energy than organized and consistent efforts well if I'm motivated and passionate about projects I'll be working all the time like a hundred percent of the time I'll forget to eat I'll forget to sleep when I'm not motivated and I just work on something because I have to then I'll be working one day mildly motivated and the next day I'll be like strongly agree oh boy remove results okay looks like i'm INFP a the mediator oh look at this butterflies and flowers talk about blood so I'm 97% introvert say that you're fine when you're not really fun 80% intuitive 51% feeling oh wow how balanced is that that's annoying because every time I have to make a decision I'm like 57% respecting I'll take it 53% are certain yeah so basically means I'm confident but not arrogant. like butter ovens so let's see what they are saying about me mediator personalities are true idealists always looking for the hands of good and everything even the worst of people and events searching for ways to make things better oh stop well they may be perceived as calm reserved or even shy that's true mediator have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine comprising just 4% of the population we're so rare I have mitigated feelings about this the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the mediator personality type but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with the Harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration mediators have a talent for self-expression revealing their beauty and secret through metaphors and fictional characteristics in personalities every week maybe that's why mediators ability with language doesn't stop with their native tongue either as with most people who share the diplomat personality types they are considered gifted when it comes to learning a second or even third language stop inflating my ego it's true because I speak French English Arabic Spanish and I'm learning German so let's move on to strengths and weaknesses so the first strengths is that I am an idealist yeah sure I favorite song of all time is what type is Bob Marley let me Google that bless your soul my and VTI brother the second strengths is that I'm open-minded and flexible true and I like that quote from Thomas T word say he's mine's only function when open very creative very true dedicated in the hard work in yeah when I'm passionate and I find true meaning in something yes when I start working on some things like you believe in it 100% and if I let it down that like I would betray myself you know now let's move on to the weaknesses too idealistic yeah that's why keep being disappointed by people so altruistic [Music] so basically my weaknesses are just good things that I have too much of like dealing with data data see I don't even know how I deal with it when I really have to but usually I'll just ask someone else to help me with things involving like hard data but yeah take things personally well the closest friends I have re n to be int P int J so you know the brutally honest ones and actually they have helped me a lot in getting a thicker skin and the last one is difficult to get to know well let's let me illustrate that with a meme thank you for watching and thanks to all of you who are subscribe and if you aren't subscribed yet then subscribe and join the tribe bye
