 hey guys so in this video I wanted to discuss the reasons why I love the intp personality now auntie peas are very interesting I know I used the word interesting a lot to describe different types but I guess interesting is one of my favorite word's but I find them very fascinating I find them to have certain qualities that I really admire even for myself and I think the best way to start is to start by looking at them cognitively now aunty peas lead with expert intuition and E this makes them see all different possibilities at once and they can see these kind of seen as like just kind of like the ENFP as I described in earlier videos is kind of a jack of all trades and a master at 9 the ante P is similar in that respect but instead of worrying about their own personal values or feelings they're just more about getting to know things and they just really want to know as much as it can so you're gonna find ent peas hoppin around to different subjects different areas of interest different just different people in general though they'll befriend people they'll want to know information and they just like to know to know where as an ENTJ which I definitely will make future videos about auntie j's are more about the utility of that knowledge whereas entp they just love knowledge for knowledge sake and they will use it in a way of persuading people and also discussing those intriguing ideas with the world they want to ante peas want to impact the world in some capacity and they're very good at it now introverted thinking this is the underlying logic behind things they're not really as concerned with hard facts you know an intp is natural troll you're gonna find that most of the trolls internet trolls are an teepees or at least that's the stereotype those are the people that will go on to YouTube pages Facebook reddit all kinds of things while they're anonymous or they show their name they're going to troll and they're going to start discussions and they really want to start discussions not because they want to fight even though they do find fighting interesting or debating interesting they just love the fun of it it's not it it's not that they really want to hurt people they just want to kind of stir up the pot and that's what I think about when I think of an teepees they're very innovative creative people and they're gonna find new ways to stir up the pot they're gonna throw fuel to the fire wherever they can just to see what the reaction is whereas like a te user again let's say an ENTJ or an INTJ they're gonna be more concerned with okay so she'll if I put fuel on this fire then this is what's going to happen like this is the fact but with an teepees they're more experimental with it they're they have they value introverted thinking that's where their creative creativity stirs from so they're going to be very experimental in that and even though maybe there might be one reaction or there might be let's say a fact associated with what happens when you throw fuel to the fire so to speak they're gonna find other ways to manipulate that and see if they can try and find different things different reactions from that same thing but in a different way and you're gonna find because they're interested in so many things and they just want to know so much about everything they're gonna seem flighty and a similar way as like say an ENFP but it's different like I said about the ENFP enfps have introverted feeling as their secondary function even though they both tepees and enfps both lead with expert intuition they're going to NFP s are going to be more concerned with how that new perspective or new situation or new person new feeling it's gonna be more based in emotions and feelings and things like that where an INTP they do it as like very they're very inquisitive and they want to just pull things out and turn them over and make people see things in a different way whether they whether they like it or not whereas an ENFP is very they can hone in on individuals emotions with introverted feeling so if they're in a group an ENFP is most likely the more considerate out of the ENFP and the ntp at least seemingly ant appease you know they don't really value introverted feeling introverted feeling at least in myers-briggs is not in their stock it's definitely in socionics and if you want to think about like shadow functions stuff like that introverted feeling is something that entities do not value they don't really care how an individual feels but they're very good at persuading people and this is this is obviously not directed on an individual emotional level even though they can still be that way it's directed because so let's say someone was doing something that was wrong and it may not even just be morally wrong but a lot of times it is or factually wrong whatever it is the NDP instead of like the ENFP the ENFP may you know try to persuade that person in a different way or like you know really listen to that person individually and kind of really associate with that person's emotions and even though they may be blunt in some ways they're not going to come off as shrewd or as you know blunt as like an intp Antibes have like a bad rep for being like these talkers or like again they're the debaters they like to be argumentative that's like a stereotype but really they just want people to realize what the truth is and what the facts actually are like not just the facts but what basically news t.i logic to persuade them in such a way that they completely change their perspective enterpise are all about changing perspectives and if they're not able to change their perspective or they feel like they are like jaw like I guess pulled down in some way where they're kind of told oh this is what you have to do and that's a they're kind of put in this box they're not going to want to be in that box and they're gonna find a way to get out of that box whatever way possible and really it means whatever way they will literally find whatever way they're not going to stay there um so moving on to actually feeling as I was saying earlier with extraverted feeling an teepees are very good at persuading people that's different than say an Effie Dom actually feeling person that leads with extra feeling either primary or secondary function especially enfjs their first function is extraverted feeling iya enough j's are known for being like these very persuasive people think of someone like oprah winfrey and even some people say like Nelson Mandela even though I've also heard infj for Nelson Mandela and I've also heard MLK as being ENFJ but I've also heard infj so either way they have extra feeling as their first or second function so those people are persuasive in a different way than say the INTP again the NTP doesn't really care how an individual feels whereas someone that leads with extra feeling or their secondary function is extra feeling there's auxiliary function they're going to be a lot more concerned even though they may not value the individual emotions and they may not be able to us easily tap into their own emotions they're going to really care and pick up on those emotions and that's not to say that an tepees can't do that or they don't care about that they certainly do and that's another stereotype is that intps are basically like these cold emotional people in a different way than say an INTJ an teepees again are like extroverted but they are very they can come off as crude and all and a bit abrasive sometimes for certain people but it's because they use extraverted feeling in such a way that they are actually able to figure out what's the best way of talking to certain people just because they have this natural charisma they have this natural ability but they use it in a way different way than again an extra feeling dominant person they're gonna use it in a way that's childlike with their expert intuition they're gonna come across is sometimes naive and sometimes just very playful in their nature they love to make tricks or play tricks they love to post memes and come up with jokes and oftentimes growing up especially when the NTP is developing you're gonna find ant appease eyes maybe even like your class clown type figure and nots not to say that other personalities can't be that way either but they're gonna have a certain flair to it to it it's gonna be not as you know in the exterior world world does like say an extra extroverted sensor like say an es F P or an intp I mean yes T P who is way more in touch with the here and now and this physical world they're gonna be an teepees are gonna come across a lot more witty and not necessarily like not to say that es f peas and es teepees aren't that way but it's a witty in a in a sense that they know so much about so many things or at least they know a little about a lot of things they're going to be able to just throw different things and they also think of different arguments for everything given a situation they can come up with so many different scenarios for that situation so for me um when I was in college as some of you know I participated in Model United Nations model Arab League Model European Union and other simulation teams and that's basically where you simulate those organizations and what I have found especially knowing more about typology and personal personality theory there are a lot of ntps in those organizations and they're very good at it if you get into an argument or a debate with the intp chances are depending on what your type is but chances are you're not going to win that argument because they're able to find a way to angle it in such a way to even make your argument like they're gonna find the little tiny details in your argument argument the different the little TI introverted thinking details that don't make the argument completely sound and they'll be able to deliver a speech even though it may seem in a way like emotionally detached they somehow are able to speak very rational very logical but also have this very persuasive and charismatic way about them they definitely have at least in my experience as an infj again I do love in teepees I have had several friends in my life thought our teepees I know of many an teepees and I've dated in teepees and I mean one of the guys that I dated I'd say it was not one of my favorite relationships that I've ever been in because it was just never boring with him and he had so many different perspectives and he was very open minded so yeah I noticed that a lot in Model UN these people that are in teepees were just able to do so well and in these simulation teams not only are these like they are competitions so you're simulating you simulates the United Nations the European Union the Arab League African Union you know all of those different things and you either play a member state so like a country or you play like in European Union or other organizations you play like a diplomat or a leader of a country and I would find personally that in almost every committee an intp would be recognized for something if they didn't get the top award they would at least be recognized for something unique about them like a lot of Antibes I've noticed even though they don't really care so much about this but they are pretty decent dressers and this might just be maybe there's just an observation that I've gone but like an topeka eyes an TP guys from my experience have figured out a way of having like a quirky style in some way not the same as an ENFP I think when I think of quirky I think of enfps interviews have like maybe a quirky Flair but it's they have also a classic flair to it that brings out their childlike nature in their outfit maybe it's a tie that's a little bit you know interesting or something like that and so I've found that an teepees will even get like Best Dressed or something like that and I think a lot of that like a lot of the superlatives that they would get we're all on the basis of not only their information and their ways about debating and putting forth certain arguments but also that natural magnetism and charisma that they seem to have and again this is a generalization so I'm not saying that all entities are the best and not all entities are interested in debating at that level but it was very interesting to see that another thing so going on to introverted sensing introverted sensing at least in myers-briggs is their last function the function in which they struggle with the most again going back to expert intuition they with expert intuition that's seeking perspective seeking new ideas seeking different experiences different information at si or introvert Ince introverted sensing is very focused on the different details of something their insurance and introverted sensing and I don't do the best at describing it but from my understanding introverted sensing is very interested in historical things they're very introverted sensors are very nostalgic in many ways but it's also a very traditional mindset especially for someone that leads with introverted sensing and it's the opposite of extraverted intuition because we're introverted actually we're expert intuition wants to explore introverted sensing is you know ok with what's familiar and this isn't a bad thing and this is not an you know let's say something negative about interpreting introverted sensing it's just a difference and. someone that is an intp that has really developed themselves will be able to chop into introverted sensing and realize that you know even though it may seem like introverted sensing is almost infringing on their sovereignty they want to be like these free agents and introverted sensing is like bringing them back to tradition to nostalgia to like routine someone that is a highly developed ntp is going to realize how important that is for them because in order to get the ball rolling on something they kind of have to be directed in their approach in some capacity and in order to succeed in the long term they really do need to tap in on those routines and on those again creating some stability in their life and when they're able to do that I find that very highly progressive or evolved an teepees are a very much force to be reckoned with and so you're gonna find someone an intp that's evolved is going to kind of like shout out all the  with like ego and they may even cut they may still come across as like confident or egotistical which I don't really find an T piece to be that way I find them to be very genuine people especially once you get to know them but they're also going to as they evolve become more comfortable with expert of feeling and introverted sensing and it will give them this kind of you know they'll be very interesting to talk to and you're never really going to be bored with them because they just cannot stand you know standing still in some capacity but they're going to have this balance where they're able to be able to keep in a routine and maintain themselves but also have that childlike nature that you know they're known and loved for so that being said there's a lot of stuff I could say about aunty peas again I really love NT peas and there's a lot to love about different types out there as well but yeah if you're an entp or if you know an INTP let me know in the comments below and let me know what types you want to see next also I just started a podcast with Michelle Wilson and ENFP and Sean or MEC he's an INTJ and again I'm an infj and our podcast is called my type of and we're going to dive deeper into the personality types and other things but yeah if you have any ideas or if you want to be interviewed on that at any point or even just contribute in some way let me know also if you like this video please like it again share it with whomever you think would enjoy this and please subscribe I will see you guys in my next video and thank you so much bye
