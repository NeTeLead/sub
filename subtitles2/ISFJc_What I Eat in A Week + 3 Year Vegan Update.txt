 [Music] guys welcome back to my channel thank you so much for being here today I'm so excited to finally do a little bit of a vegan update and I challenged myself this week to record every single meal that I ate which is kind of can be embarrassing or just like really exposing yourself and your diet and I originally my idea was to challenge myself to cook every single meal at home which I did for the most part but then there were instances where I was out and about and I hadn't pre-made my food so I just ended up eating something reasonably unhealthy but still vegan so I don't know I just kind of wanted to show you what a vegan eats in a week and this isn't something that you should completely model your diet awesome I guess this is one thing that I really wanted to move into is just being more aware of my diet and how foods are making me feel and cooking 80 percent of my meals before I get too far into this I wanted to give a shout out to the sponsor of today's video which is Skillshare and I thought that they would fit perfectly with this video because Skillshare is an online learning community for creators with over 25,000 different classes in business and design and so much more and with a Premium Membership you can join any classes that you want and join these communities a lot of the times the teachers will actually interact with the students and have different assignments and prompts for the week and I just think that this was a really great connection to wanting to improve your life by doing something consistently over a period of time I personally loved the sewing classes and the animation classes those are both things that I am very passionate about but I don't really share on camera I desire that later in my life I can do those things also as part of my career I'm not ready to share my progress on this yet because I have a lot of work to do let's just say that but yeah there are seriously so many different classes on Skillshare and it's also super affordable so an annual membership is less than $10 get some meditation when you're in the moment creating something with your hands or the sewing machine or with your laptop and then after you have this wonderful thing you created it's like it brings childlike joy so I just really love Skillshare so much and if you want to check it out the first 500 people who click the first link in my bio will get it two months free of Skillshare so please do if it's calling you and you have some creative endeavor that you'd like to pursue check it out and thank you Skillshare for sponsoring my video I really appreciate it [Music] I started off my morning on Monday with a nice vegetable stir-fry I cut up a bunch of broccoli and red pepper & carrot and just put it all in a pan with some water and then I love the water dissolved so that the vegetables could get a little bit crispy I added some Korean sweet potato which was so yummy and topped it off with a ginger tahini dressing which I'll have link down below because it's really good and I discovered it in India and just kind of started making my own version of it so that was my breakfast which is pretty savory and then for dinner on Monday I made my own pizza dough and then chopped a bunch of vegetables up once again and so much garlic got some tomato sauce on there and just made a veggie pizza it was really simple and not too heavy and really delicious I ate literally the whole entire thing everything that I made I consumed and I also really love this with nutritional yeast which is sometimes used as a cheese substitute through really good on Tuesday for breakfast I had the exact same thing roasted stir-fry vegetables I had some sesame seeds and of course this brush tahini ginger dressing because it just has a really great flavor and it's relatively light I ate the rest of the Korean sweet potato with some of the sauce because it was really good and I didn't want to waste it and then for lunch on Tuesday once again it's kind of boring I made two little slices of pizza one with vegan cheese and one without and for dinner I had a burrito kind of situation this is tofu scramble with peppers onions spinach and some home fries and I wrapped it all up into a tortilla because I was just really craving a breakfast burrito TBH it was really good and to get some more health in me I've made some carrot and celery juice and that was really good night cap on Wednesday I started off with some avocado toast on some like seed bread that was really yummy and I just like my Abu toast with Himalayan pink salt and pepper and then I had some Katrine it's just lentils and rice and really good spices and I added a little bit of spicy garlic sauce and yeah okay I'm gonna try this one sounds good - oh that's good Wow for lunch on Wednesday I had even more ah photos these pieces of bread were pretty small so I just knocked on those and then I had some Japanese sweet potato I normally don't eat this much potato but for some reason I just had a lot in my kitchen so for dinner I had the other half of my Japanese sweet potato and I made some broccoli rabe and bok choy just season with some lemon and garlic and it was so good and some Buffalo hummus which oh so delicious this was like a really nice light meal for dinner and Thursday's breakfast was I started off with some apple cider vinegar with turmeric agave and cayenne and then also had some AVO toast with sesame seeds and Himalayan pink salt and pepper baby and then I had a matcha at this coffee shop called homecoming for lunch I had pizza this was the first pizza I had and so long and it was so good this is vegan pizza from Polly cheese they have I think three or four vegan options so I really loved those I ran into a friend and had a third slice of pizza just because I just I needed to I guess and Thursday's center was relatively late because I had pizza so this bowl of vegetables just consisted of broccoli rabe a some bok choy chard and beets and onions it was really really delicious and then I had a second bowl of chard with a tiny piece of Abu toast on the side on Friday for breakfast I had the same vegetable stir-fry I did some squash this time and just really went ham with the veggies and then of course I made the same ginger tahini sauce poured over it and I also made these random wraps of avocado and sweet potato just just really random I was really craving seaweed so I decided to make little seaweed wraps and I had a bunch of those and then a little bit later I had some avocado toast once again with sesame seeds and then for lunch on Friday I had these really random noodles I was honestly just really hungry and this was the only option that I felt was something I wanted to eat in my neighborhood so yeah these are just like spicy rice noodles and it was really good and I had some chai tea after that chai tea latte and for dinner I honestly wasn't that hungry but my friend is reading so I ordered something off the menu I was like I'm just gonna have a bite and save the rest of this for tomorrow but of course ate the whole thing and it was really good this is an impossible burger from this place called bear burger in New York and it's completely vegan and delicious and then I ended the night with some apple cider vinegar cayenne turmeric because it's just good for you and I actually drink this every day I just kind of forgot to film it every day but I had this drink every day of the week and Saturday I started off with some simple oats with some dried blueberries some coconut almond milk and water you know I drink so much water and I just needed to say shout out to water I added some goji berries and some sunflower seeds turmeric chia seeds and granola on top. for lunch on Saturday I had a slice of pizza from screamers pizza with extra nutritional yeast and I just loved this one because as broccoli an extra sauce I loved both of those things and then first Mac I had extra broccoli rabe with lemon this is one of my favorite meals I don't know why I love the flavor of broccoli rabe and some people call it broccoli rabe eh but yeah I just had a bowl of that and then for dinner on Saturday I once again made a breakfast burrito with tons of spinach onions red peppers avocado home fries and a hot sauce on top it was so delicious and this is tofu scramble I just seasoned it with tumeric and cumin and chili powder and salt and pepper for Sunday's breakfast I started off once again with some apple cider vinegar lemon turmeric and cayenne and then I had once again the stir-fried vegetables with ginger tahini sauce I added some crispy garlic on top avocado and some seaweed on the side because I really love seaweed [Music] for lunch on Sunday I decided to make some tofu nuggets I attempted making some green split peas but they came out really bad so I was like okay I'm gonna make some tofu nuggets dip them in flour and then dip in almond milk and some bread crumbs and then I just put them in a pan to get a little bit crispy on the outside on the stovetop and then into the oven to cook and get like fully crispy on the inside I smothered some of them in hot sauce looks like some of them are red and had those with a big side of vegetables just my classic broccoli and red pepper and it was really good but I felt kind of shitty after like I felt bloated for the first time and the whole week after eating those so I wouldn't recommend I snacked on some strawberries a little bit later and have a light dinner of broccoli rabe a once again my fave like literally favorite meal ever and then I had a second bowl of vegetables with crispy crunchy chickpeas on top and a side of rice so that is everything that I eat in a week I really don't know I feel kind of vulnerable putting this out on the internet because I am NOT a nutritionist and perhaps I'm not as well-informed as I think I don't know I feel like I still have so much to learn and I used to think back in the day when I first went vegan and when I was 19 I'm 21 now so that was like two years ago pretty much I thought that when I went vegan my eating disorder was over and I thought when I felt happier that my depression was over not really realizing that these things just come in waves and that we'll always have a relationship with our mental health and with our food that will constantly be changing and I felt like yeah I had succeeded in understanding what my body needed and then my body's needs changed and then I felt really stressed out again like damn it and I went through quite a few phases of that throughout my veganism and also throughout my mental health until I found some solutions that always worked for me and really realized that yeah it's a relationship that relationship will always change and that is the only true fact is that everything is always changing so it feels really good to just be fully aware of that I have been vegan for three years if you didn't know I went vegan cold turkey I was in college for the short time that I did go to college in Santa Barbara California baby I watched Earthlings which was earth-shattering to me and I'm a very empathetic creature I cried I felt so emotional I felt like I just really wanted to stand up for the animals and I mean it was like okay I'm going vegan I felt so good I felt amazing and I was so excited to embark on this vegan journey and from then I watched 101 reasons to go vegan and so many other documentaries including what the health and more scientific so to speak documentaries that really showed how veganism affects the health of your body and what eggs do to your body what meat those to your body over time and I noticed the after I stopped drinking milk and stopped eating cheese that my skin cleared up so much everything just seems so easy to replace and I just really loved it so I went vegan cold turkey and eventually after I moved to New York City I learned about the high carb low fat diet in veganism which many of you may be aware of it was such a big fad diet and I didn't realize how restrictive it actually was because everyone talked about it so casually and it really made me afraid to eat fat so for about a whole year and a half ish I eat mostly potatoes as my diet and I felt really good once again I lost a lot of weight my skin was great not eating any oil it's just amazing for your skin so I was even happier about that had energy but that only lasted for about a year a good year I'll say but then I started to get really dizzy I started to feel really nutrient deficient I started to feel like I was gonna faint all the time and I was like I cannot do this anymore this is actually really fucked up and bad for me so I started to try and diversify my diet and just eat a bigger variety of foods and eat junk foods and slowly learn not to be afraid of fat and oil which your body needs and I also learned that starchy carbs dense carbs like pastas and mostly potatoes takes so much energy for your body to process and that's really tiring for your digestive system it just uses up so much energy and I read this book I think it's called thrive what is the most efficient diet for the human body you know how can you truly make your body thrive and he started following that diet which was a vegan diet and he has a bunch of recipes in the book as well and I fell in love with it it's basically a nutrient-dense diet I realized how much more efficient it was for my body to be getting the most nutrients that it can and to be getting a balanced amount of fats and oils along with the amount of carbs that I need they're easier to break down and it make me so happy once again made a whole video about that on my channel I'm in a fricken bikini in it I don't know why and then the next thing that happened on my vegan journey was the bloating period which most vegans go through pretty early on but I had not experienced bloating like this until two years in being vegan where I was bloated every single day where a blueberry would make me pop where I would wake up bloated and it was painful and it was horrible and eventually I saw a vegan nutritionist who told me that very simply I had an overgrowth of Candida everyone has Candida but having too much of it it's bad I think I was floating and I made a whole video talking about my experience with the vegan nutritionist so she gave me some probiotics to take she said take these before every meal they will protect your stomach and they will just give more of the good bacteria that you need into your gut and she kind of taught me about gut health it was pretty basic information that she was telling me she would just tell me what we're in certain fruits and vegetables just really simple knowledge that I could have found myself but I think I really did need her to give me the solution and hold me accountable for what I was eating just kind of guide me through what was going on inside my body which I am really grateful for and eventually my bloating started to go away and the main I think problem that was causing my candida overgrowth was the amount of sugar that I was eating I was eating a lot of natural sugar like I would eat a whole carton of strawberries or three whole mangos for breakfast or like five bananas in a day and that's because once again I saw a bunch of vegans eating high volumes of fruit I tried to implement little parts of those diets into my life and they just kind of made me feel sick so I started to eat just one serving of sugar every single day taking my probiotics logging my food but yeah the main difference in my diet that ended my bloating was the amount of sugar that I was eating including cars because carbs turn into sugar I would eat quinoa instead of rice and I didn't eat any potatoes during this time my bloating completely went away so that was amazing I felt amazing after seeing this change in my body and slightly changing my diet from there that lasted for a while last winter I traveled to Thailand Bali and Japan I went through yoga teacher training I was releasing a lot of emotional shit and I had fallen in love with this beautiful man who I'm still with and it was really hard I wanted to run away from the love I felt on my past trauma is just screaming in my face I felt afraid a lot and I was breaking out I felt really exhausted and I was like is this happening is it the vegan diet you know if what is going on I started that's when I really started supplementing taking my vitamins every single day because I really wanted to take care of the body and make sure that it wasn't deficient I went through my yoga teacher training and actually was able to heal a lot of the problems that I felt you know the the fatigue the brain fog the low motivation the low self-esteem the happiness yoga hatha yoga specifically Tantra hatha yoga more specifically is what really transformed all of those chronic things that I was feeling and made them completely disappear made me feel amazing so after that I went to Japan which was kind of hard to find vegan options I ate like soba noodles everyday and just white rice and really basic stuff I went to the pasta now which is a 10-day meditation I was only allowed to eat two meals a day there which were all mostly like soba noodles and brown rice I personally loved but it was basically a high carb low fat diet I got back to New York I filmed it what I eat in a day and I wasn't really aware of how skinny I was but a lot of people started leaving me comments about it people made videos about how skinny I was and my breaking and my skin was still breaking out and healing from that so people were like making fun of my skin how skinny and disproportionate my boobs were to my body people were saying like my boobs look so fake compared to my body and if I'm vegan why would I have implants and I do not have implants but some people's boobs are composed more of fat than others so some people who have big boobs when they lose weight their boobs get smaller because they're mostly made of fat and then other people who have more like firm breast tissue when they lose weight their boobs can stay the same size and that's always been the case for me no matter what size I've been so people were just saying a lot of stuff about my body I really wanted to prove to myself that I was an ortho x'q and then I wasn't afraid of food because that was a really big thing that people were saying like oh I bet she doesn't even eat that food like she's so skinny you can see her ribs and no wonder she's breaking out she's not eating and I was like I can eat it's like I'm fucking eating so I don't know I guess for the past like half of a year I've been eating a lot of vegan junk food more than I think it's healthy I would be eating like vegan nacho platter and then an oily falafel and that would be all I would eat for the whole day like three days in a row I would just eat the same thing and I would just feel like shit because it's not the same as cooking for yourself it's oily it's just unhealthy doesn't feel like it's made with love and you're just putting it into your mouth just because you need to feed yourself like that's pretty much what I was doing is eating just because I needed to and I was like okay this is substantial like you can't say that I'm worth or exha core like I didn't want to have to worry about getting too skinny or something doesn't really make sense at all I know but the whole time I was in India I really realized my relationship to food wasn't feeling good and so I came back to New York and decided to challenge myself to cook every single meal that I ate in a whole week and I obviously did not complete that perfectly but I did cook most of my meals at home the junk food that I was craving I made for myself at home which was a little bit healthier and it felt really good I was like sending pictures to my partner all week just of the different meals I was making so excited even if it was really basic like my broccoli tahini breakfast bowl like it just felt so good to get creative in the kitchen and to nourish myself it truly felt like self-love this whole past week and that is the biggest breakthrough that I had in these seven days yeah was that I can love myself their food I can heal myself through food I feel so much lighter in my body and I also want to say that I think a lot of people associate your weight with your health and before I went to India I filmed a lookbook it was a winter lookbook and I got a few comments saying you're so skinny sad face and people assuming that because I was skinny that must mean that I'm restricting my food or that I am somehow trying to lose weight but in reality I was actually eating like the worst food for me which by that I just mean like processed vegan junk all the time which isn't good only eating that stuff you know and somehow still staying skinny or losing weight through that I don't really know how that makes sense and I was like damn I really have to just not worry about how people are perceiving my health or my appearance and just really listen to what my body needs and if my natural healthy state of my body is to be like slender for some reason I stay slender reminds me of Slenderman but if my natural healthy body is just a skinny body and a smaller frame and a smaller waist then I just have to accept that and not be like changing my diet because of what I think my body is supposed to look like I guess I was afraid to eat healthy because I was afraid to become orther x''k and get skinnier and be shamed and I just don't think that's right and I don't know why I was doing that for so long and as you can see from this week I don't eat completely healthy but healthy to me means making most of my own meals controlling how much oil is in certain things and controlling my own portion sizes depending on what I want and I'm not trying to lose weight I just want to eat healthy and intuitively and eat mostly vegetables I think that's just like a healthy rule of thumb is to eat mostly vegetables even if your aren't vegan I don't know if you guys have struggled with orthorexia but it's basically when you become obsessed with eating healthy and you don't want to eat anything unhealthy in your life so you just I think a lot of vegans actually have done this use veganism as a way to continue their eating disorder because it is such a healthy diet that you can lose a lot of weight on I just really don't want that to be the case for me I'm so brambly right now I don't know why I'm so family I'm like all over the place because I'm not like an informative vegan I feel like I I don't have all the facts I don't have all the tips I just have my experience to share and so I'll just share that and then leave the professionals to talk about veganism leave the nutritionist to talk about all the good juicy facts so I'll have a bunch of documentaries and the book that I mentioned earlier down below I definitely very encouraging of the but I just don't want to be a preachy vegan some people who are vegan will probably get annoyed at me for being like you have such a big platform why aren't you being more informative or preaching veganism but I'm just I just don't want to preach about that because I know everyone's body is so different it's so sensitive and it's a sensitive issue what you're putting in your body so I just refuse to shame people's diets it's just not a natural thing for me to do so I will just happily I'll be hit by example maybe give you a meal idea or two and definitely send you over to the professionals I just don't have the energy and meets a hate or shame or preach to others why the way that I'm eating is better than the way they are eating and yeah I guess that's all I have to say for today the Sun is like shining in in my room now don't forget if you would like to try to three months of
