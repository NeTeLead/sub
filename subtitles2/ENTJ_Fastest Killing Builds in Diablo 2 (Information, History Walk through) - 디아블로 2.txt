 what is going on guys Xmas here today I present you the top 5 fastest killing builds in Diablo 2 with a complete guide of the skills attributes along with some of the highest and game gear available in the game what's going on guys Xmas here so I'm gonna be showing you guys each class filled in this list and I'm gonna be showing you guys all the in-game gear all the skills attributes and all that good stuff and go over a little bit more information with you guys as well so coming in at number 5 is the windy druid here so as far as the skills go just remember guys keep this in mind that this is level 99 so this is with all the skill class and all that stuff so you really want to make sure if you do follow these builds you want to make sure that you're using your points correctly instead of just dumping them in the wrong places at the wrong time what I mean by that is you don't want to be dumping points into twister instead of tornado first you want to make sure you put points in the tornado first because you're gonna be using tornado in that twister so as we go along with the build you want to put this is very young game like I said guys so you want to put 20 points in the cyclone armor 20 twister 20 tornado 20 hurricane and 20 oak sage and then you get a little bit more extra points left over and actually put that in the summon grizzly I'm actually a little bit too lazy to summon them just because I don't want to really but I never really used a windy druid that had that many points left over to where he could put points in to summon grizzly so if you wanted to do that you can go ahead and do that as well so this is very basic gear guys I'm using the Shaco helm right now and that's probably one of the biggest things I want to point out to you guys because with a druid you can actually get a druid helm and a lot of these two Tom's cuz that could have some really nice stats on that like to the Drude skills through the tornado things like that and those are actually really hard to come by in the trading community I mean some people keep them you can actually make a delirium you can get like 3/2 tornado on a white druid home that make a delirium that'll actually give you about five skill levels two tornado that's a little bit different some people just go with Shaco because they like the magic find and things like that so this is actually very basic gear and this isn't anything too crazy so I'm actually using hodo Shaco maras you could actually get a little bit more damage out of it if you went with a 3-2 elemental skills amulet but that's really not necessary I mean one skill is gonna make or break your character but I mean Mars is really nice for thirty resistances and their attributes and things like that I'm using a nygma spirit shield war traveler boots stone the Jordan Iraq the mesh and mage fist gloves that's which I got called arms and spirit and all I'm elemental skill green charms and II and the torch and then on the mercenary I'm using the Infinity treachery and vampire case so one thing I wanted to point out with infinity this really doesn't help out a druid that much it's really only gonna help out the hurricane damage and that's only if there's non cold immune monsters so one of the biggest things that's a problem with kolduny monsters is it's really hard to break the cold immunities on those monsters so a lot of people ask all the time in the Diablo 2 community how do you break cold immunities in Diablo 2 and the answer to that is there's only two things that actually apply to route to removing resistances from a monster in the game and that's a lower resist which has occurs from a necromancer it's a necromancer spell but you could get it on the wand and conviction which is a paladin aura or that's on infinity so even with infinity and the lower resists combined together I really don't think that's I'm not too sure you guys might have to look that up I don't think that that's enough resistances negative resistance is to actually take the cold immunities off and actually tried testing it and it didn't work and what I did is I actually used a conviction where I from a paladin I use lower assist and I actually took off some of the cold immunities from there and and that's really hard to come by I mean a lot of people don't play conviction paladin's or anything like that anymore or origins so that's really something that that's kind of a disadvantage to a lot of people that do cold damage in Diablo 2 is because so many monsters and hell mode have very high resistances so you really can't break their their resistances and take that cold immunity off because you don't have enough negative resistance on that monster to take it off lightning damage and fire damage is a little bit different because lightning damage a lot of the monsters in Diablo 2 do not have as much lightning resist as they do cold resists and that's why lightning can get can get removed from monsters and cold damage most of the time can so I'm just gonna make sure that the players are set to eight and then we'll get it started so what the oaks age right now I got about six thousand six thousand six hundred health I'm doing six point eight K damage on the tornadoes and 3k damage on the hurricane so we're just gonna go the world some keep instead and I'll show you guys. as you can see there with those snakes that little snake back and took them out pretty quick there. and there's actually a lot of these I spawn deeds it's weird really don't like how those guys give you like no items oh my gosh and another pack of them it's a third pack I've seen. so as you can see I mean they take out everything very easily one of the nice things about tornadoes as well as that does physical damage and a lot of monsters in Diablo 2 aren't immune to physical damage so most the time you can just go around and kill whatever you want as to where some other bills in Diablo - like a cold sorceress for example really can't go around killing many things in Diablo - just because there's so many cold immunities and with a windy druid I mean it's it's really nice to just be able to go around and fight whatever whatever monster you want and actually get away with it we're a cold sorceress you you just you can't do that alright so moving on the number four is the trap the SATs and traps essence is definitely one of the most overpowered classes in the game and builds in the game that I really don't see a lot of people playing I mean you could really get away with making a awesome character for a lot cheaper than a hammer tin se or a sorceress going over the gear with you guys real quick so this is the biggest thing I want to talk about with this build is the silence face plate know a lot of people go ahead and use hodo and things like that but this is a really big thing with trap assassins I had to learn this the hard way when I first started playing assassins is that your your casting speed for your traps is not based on your faster castrate it's based on your attack speed so you really want to make sure that you have a weapon that has very fast attack speed such as the phase blade and that's why I made a silence in the face plate so silence is really nice gives to doll skills and that massive 75% to all resistances and it's a really nice base weapon right there the face plate so you're really going to be casting your traps really fast but at the same time it's also nice to have faster cash rate just so you could teleport around really quickly when using enigma so obviously I'm using a dig my shaco Amara's spirit war traveler boots to stones of jordan arachnid mesh and some training i'll gloves so the reason why i put a cham rune and my shaco just because i really don't want to be frozen you could go ahead and just put a raven frost if you wanted to on your character but i really wanted to get that that one extra skill just so I could do some more damage and the Cham rune I mean that's totally personal by me you can go ahead and just put a perfect topaz in there if you want to get more magic finder you're using this character the magic find so and then on switch I got called arms spirit very standard all traps killed green terms Andy at or CH and then this is pretty obvious as well I'm using the infinity for the conviction Ora treachery and and burials so as far as the skills go like I said guys this is very endgame here 20 points desk death traps 20 lightning traps 20 charge traps and 20 shock web and then you're gonna get a little bit more points left over it but one point in the burst of speed martial arts none some people like to put points in the shadow master and things like that or cloak of shadows maybe just to help out with the mercenaries damage a little bit with a negative defense going on there but with the rest of my points so you just put 20 points in all the all the traps right here on the left and then with the rest of my points I put them in the fire blast because then you're gonna you're gonna put up all your traps throw up a shock web and then you can start throwing those fire blasts at the monsters as well and that's kind of overkill right there I mean you're really going to be doing a lot of damage already but if you're really trying to pump out some crazy damage I mean maybe if you're doing like eight player cow runs throw the destruction on the last wave or something like that I mean all these traps right here lightning traps corpse explosion trap a shock web in the fire blast I mean you're just it's insane the amount of damage that you're pumping out if you play the character correctly alright so we got the player set to eight and we're gonna go ahead and use the frigid Highlands just so we can keep it all all even here and kill the same monsters just so we can see how much damage each class can do alright so what you want to do is you want to make sure that you have five traps up so you want to have four Lightning traps and one corpse explosion trap you want to make sure you don't mix it up or anything or overlap your traps or it's going to delete the one that you catched it before so usually what I do is I just spam a bunch of lightning traps and then put up one death trap and then what you want to do is that while that once you're done with that you want to throw up a shock web and then start throwing your fire blasts so then you're just going to be doing a ridiculous amount of damage right there. and they're gonna be dead by the time we even start Sammy they're already dead by the time I even started casting fireblast so I mean it's like instant kill right there. and easy does it I mean traps assets are just awesome and I don't know if you guys know Gore bag back in the day he was one of like the Diablo 2 veteran youtubers is actually a little bit older than a lot of us but he actually played the trap assassin I think way back in the day he had like a level 99 so big shot of the gore bag kind of just gave me giving a reminder there of one of the Diablo 2 veterans so alright so I'm moving on to the next class the massively famous hammered in so the hammer Dan is probably number one or number two on the most played class in Diablo 2 it's definitely the number one bodied class in Diablo 2 just because it does so much damage they have so much defense and so much survivability it's just absolutely overpowered in the beginning of concentration and blastomeres back in patch 1.04 I think blessed hammer working with concentration was actually a bug in the game it wasn't supposed to work that way in classic Diablo 2 concentration boosting hammers was a bug in the game Blizzard fixes but the hammers became too weak to be a useful skill later on the patch 1.05 Blizzard gave the damage boost from concentration back to the hammers this was a little bit strange because Holy Bowl gives magic damage just like hammers do but it does not get the bonus from the aura blessed hammers also used to ignore the immunity monsters gave to magic damage and the current version of Diablo - hammers do not work against magic and moon monsters well holy bolts do which is why you see hammer dens casting holy bolts on wave 2 of bail runs so going on with the build here you want to put 20 points in the blast tamer 20 points in the holy shield if you have extra points left over 20 points in the concentration Tony blasting and 20 vigor and I put the rest of my points into defiance and just won them to salvation I mean you could do that if you want sometimes if you run into the councilmembers and tribe or something like that they have a conviction or else so that really helped with your resistance is there this is something I put up there just get some extra resistance in just in case alright so and as far as the gear goes I'm using the heart of the oak enigma Shaco maras war traveler boots two stones are Jordan Iraq the mesh and mage fist gloves this is basically the same exact thing as the elemental druid that I just showed you guys except for the shield using the herald of zaqqum quintero the sacrum has always been my favorite paladin shield I mean just all around and gives you to the combat skills to the Paladin skills and it's just all around a really nice shield I mean 52 all resistances 20 strength 20 vitality it's just like every single stat on this shield is just absolutely amazing and in my opinion it's the best Paladin shield in the game next to something like Exile something with my inventory I'm using all combat skill green charms and a me the torch CTA and spirit on switch and with the mercenary I'm using an insight treachery and a G face you should probably actually switch out that G face or something that gives like life leech such as in dario's or crown of these blood G faces a fine item for right now I mean if that's what you have I would just go ahead and throw it down there but you want to make sure you have some life leech on your mercenary this guy actually has none but at this level I mean this is a very high level paladin and I mean I'm sure I'm just gonna be taking out months or so fast and I mean you're not even gonna be worried about your mercenary alright so as far as the attributes go I'll put it on points in the strength use my gear and enough dexterity to get 75% chance to block which is the max block rate but you want to make sure that you put in on points into that when your holy shield is casted don't go trying to put points in your dexterity trying to get max block if your holy shield is not casted so you really want to make sure that you do that and then put the rest of my points into vitality right there so we'll get to started right here I'm gonna make sure that the players are set to eight like always on each character that we do and I'll show you guys the damage going on here. I would definitely say that the hammer didn't is the best all-around class in the game as far as defense damage and all that good stuff survivability I mean you're a-- you're a spellcaster and you have 19,000 defense that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense but that's just a way way it is right now so as you guys can see right there very simple very easy all around in my opinion the best build in Diablo 2 as far as PVM goes 19,000 defense you know 4,000 life 16 to 16 K damage max block I mean it just doesn't get any better than that alright so moving on to the next class right here is that javelin Amazon definitely one of the most popular classes in Diablo 2 as far as kill speed goes I mean you don't even need all this fancy gear here I mean you could just have a normal Titan Titans revenge and basically just be naked with everything else and you'll still be plowing through Cal level and things like that very easily with a javelin Amazon I really think a lot of people don't take advantage of this class and it's build enough and I really think it needs to be seen more in the Diablo 2 community so but going over the gear real quick so we're obviously using titans revenge one of the biggest things that's important about titans revenge and why a lot of people don't use thunderstroke I don't know if you guys know about Thunder shoka is actually a higher level unique javelin and Diablo 2 and the reason why a lot of people don't use Thunder stroke is because it doesn't have replenish quantity on it so you're really gonna be running out of your javelins really quick and it really gets old really fast when you're running out of your javelins all the time and having the repair rate so this is really nice because the stack size is a lot higher than thunderstroke and not only that like I said it has a replenishes quantity mod on it so that's really gonna help out a lot but anyway I mean it's still all around an awesome weapon to use I mean to the javelin skills to they Amazon skills faster run walk speed 200 a and stay image that's the maximum amount of enhance damage on it varies from 150 to 200 I mean even if you have a 150 Titans revenge I mean it's really not gonna make a difference it's still gonna make make an awesome weapon for your character just because it's a hundred and fifty enhanced damage on it doesn't mean that it's not worth anything and a lot of people will tell you that and a lot of people were lower the value of items like this in Diablo 2 just because it's the lowest possible stat but that doesn't mean that the item isn't extremely extremely useful to your character so a lot of the people in Diablo 2 just kind of really lower the value of things just because of that but at the same time I mean that's kind of a an advantage for you because you're getting an item cheaper so anything as far as the rest of the bill goes I'm using enigma this is really nice just because you want to teleport around a little bit I mean if you're trying to do magic fine drones and do things like that I would suggest you at least having enigma on switcher and in your inventory but I would go ahead and use chains if I'm gonna actually have a fortitude on here and that's something you could use as well I would really suggest that you guys use the chains of honor so then I'm using the cat's-eye amulet this is really nice for the faster run walk speed on it I really prefer that and set up any other ambulant just because you're not gonna be using a nygma well I'm not gonna be using an enigma from my personal preferences and the monsters that I want to kill so I'm not really gonna be teleporting around unless I really want to kill like Mephisto or something like that so faster run walk speed is a really big big advantage for a javelin Amazon you also get 25 to dexterity and some other nice monster as well and then as far as the helmet goes I'm using Griffin's eye this is pretty obvious for lightning damage on it one-off skills I put that cannot be frozen sham rune in there just to get just get that cannot be frozen and as far as my rings and belt go goes I'm using two main old heals this is really important for me personally just because I want to get a lot of mana mana leech out of my character and I really don't want to be chugging on the pots all the time you can go ahead and put like a raven frost on there if you want to switch that out for a lightning jewel I mean the possibilities are endless in Diablo 2 and it's really up to you what you want to do learn the items a little bit more and learn about what you want from your character you can really go ahead and just customize things that you want to do based on your preference so they don't use them razortail this is a really big big item right here because you want to get that piercing attack and that's gonna be a big chunky or damage right there I'm using all their boots 40% faster run walk walk speed on they're really nice from my personal preference for faster unlock speed 50 live 50 the fire resistances it's just all around a really nice pair of boots and I think a lot of people just don't put them to good use just because they just don't realize that they're good boots so this is really nice has a really high chance to block and actually goes up even higher if you if you upgrade the item using a lemco in the perfect diamond so that's actually going to increase the block rate on it so a lot of times it's really important to upgrade your shield and I put two lightning facets in there I would really have to dump a lot of points into my character just to get to just to get to use a spear at monarch so in my opinion it's it's definitely a lot better to just get a saigon shield and it's really not gonna be worth it to get that one more skill just because they're gonna have to dump so many points in the string just to use a spirit shield and then i'm using the crafted blood touch gloves now these are actually a really rare find right here this is something that you're really not going to come across very often in Diablo - this is very endgame stuff right here and a very expensive pair of gloves so I wouldn't expect going around and finding a pair of gloves like this alright so going on with the build here I got enough points in to strengthen my attributes to use my gear same thing with that stair D just enough to use the gear energy nun and the rest vitality now if you wanted to you could go ahead and use something like a storm shield or you could even use this field like this and you can go from axe block that's something and I would recommend doing but at the same time I mean it's not gonna make or break your character so it's whatever you want to do based on your preference as far as the skills go 20 points in lightning fury 20 points lightning strike 20 points charge strike 20 points in lightning bolt and then arrest your points in to power strike you want to make sure that you max that out as well once you get to the maximum level in Diablo 2 about Tom you might not have that many points left over so I would definitely just make sure you put points in the power strike last and as far as passive skills you want to make sure you put one point into all of these right here on the right you could also go from Valkyrie if that's your thing or if you just want to you know have your Valkyrie up that's something that a lot of people personally prefer but for me it's really not a big deal and I kind of just concentrate on my character and if you want to put a point into Valkyrie you could do that as well and as far as the boat boat skills I put them down in there I'm using infinity treachery and I'm Dario's helmet so infinity is just all-around I mean just very standard and game year for your mercenary for any spellcaster except for you know certain circumstances like if you're using a cold sorceress or things like that because infinity isn't gonna break the immunities from it so it's really just gonna be a little bit worthless something on that side of on that side of the endgame part of killing monsters you're just not gonna be able to break immunities but it will help out killing the monsters I mean if the monster is in cold immune so I mean it's totally up to you and what you want to do alright so going on with this build right here so charge strike is really gonna be doing a ridiculous I'm on the damage the boss is right here I'm actually gonna leave the game and make sure we set in on the players so you could actually take out bail bail in about two seconds using charge strike it's this absolutely absolutely ridiculous I mean it's so overpowered I mean I don't even know know how that how to say how overpowered this is same thing with lightning Furies so I go ahead and I just use lightning fury or lightning theory let's see lightning fury and lightning bolt so lightning bolt is gonna do more damage but lightning fury is gonna do more of a spread damage so this is basically like the Amazons version of lightning and Chain Lightning right so lightning only does basically like about single target damage and when you use Chain Lightning it's kind of spreading out that damage it's the same thing here with the lightning bolt and lightning fury so by the time I get up here I mean they're just gonna be dead once that conviction auras on them I mean it's it's it's over. I mean so easy I mean I just made like two or three clicks to the mouse and it's done it's over sometimes I really don't like Elgar it's just because a lot of times he has mana leech or monitoring whatever it is bugs me so bad so I got those man old heals. and a weird or right there this is leaving the maximum damage right here I mean like I said guys you could put four lightening jewels in there you could put four Lightning tools in your shield I mean there's just so many more things that you can do I don't even have my skill grand charms on this guy and it's just just look at that this one hit just plows through through everything. it's just absolutely insane. totally forgot what button I had charge strike on I've been played these characters in a long time guys so sorry if I'm a little bit a little bit rusty here same thing there you go he's done very easy very simple extremely overpowered all right so moving on to the number one class in Diablo 2 that has the fastest killing speed in the game and that's the lightning sorceress now all around this does a massive amount of damage but at the same time it's survivability isn't as good as say I hammered in in Diablo 2 like I just showed you guys because he has max block 19,000 defense he's this all around the very good damage dealing character but not only that has very good survivability the survivability is not as good on this character but it's just the damages is absolutely ridiculous and you're gonna be teleporting around really fast you're gonna be able to do magic fine runs and just do everything you want to do in the game and if in a fast and effective way where say if you're using something like a javelin Amazon you're really not gonna be able to just teleport wherever you want to go just because they're faster caster a break points and they're faster cast rate compared to other classes is a lot slower compared to say a sorceress or a paladin or even a barbarian their casting speed is so slow so you're really gonna be teleporting around the world really slow and with the Lightning sorceress you're gonna be pumping out a lot of damage but you're gonna be able to do whatever you want to do in the game alright so going on with the gear right here I'm using ash to does temper I don't even know if that's the right way to pronounce that so I just call it the elder itch or whatever you want to call ash Judah so this gives three the sorceress kills and 25% the lightning skill damage with a lightning facet in it so and that's actually a perfect one right there so you're really gonna be dumping out a lot of damage right there there's a lot of orbs that you could come across that are really rare they're actually rare orbs but they're really hard to come by and a lot of people really don't find them the only people that kind of find them or bots and things like that I really think that you might be able to get orb that's better than this one just because you can get a lot of skills say you can get like a blue magic orb and they could have two two sockets and a bunch of different lightning skills I mean there's a lot of crazy items in this game but that is very engaged and those are usually things that are normally found by BOTS those usually aren't something that the normal casual player like you or myself come across in Diablo 2 something like this is much more standard because people see it and they keep it a lot of people don't always go and identify rare orb that's just sitting on the ground just because the chances of it being good are you know one in ten twenty thousand you know so this is really something that you're going to come across and more often in Diablo 2 all right something as far as the rest of my gear goes I'm using in the Ormus robe just has three the Lightning on it perfect percent right there it gives twenty percent of lightning skill damage I'm using a four socket monarch right here this is a gmod right here so this is something that's really expensive I would just go ahead and get a four socket white monarch instead but for lightening jewels in there and that's really pumping out a ridiculous amount of lightning damage right there mmmm using Griffin's eye Mara's mage fist two stones of Jordan Iraq nimesh and some so qui boots along with all lightning skill grand charms with an ami and the torch now on switch I'm using a call to arms and a spirit monarch very standard stuff and as far as a mercenary goes same thing I mean infinity treachery and I got a vampire gaze going right there so then as far as the skill points go I put one point in the warmth one point in the teleport twenty points in the charged bolt lightning chain lightning and thunder storm and then lightning mastery as well and make sure you put one point in the static field and you're gonna have to do that anyway just get the thunderstorm and then I got five points left over so you could probably just go ahead and put some points in the warmth if you want some more mana recovery there or get some frozen armor whatever it is you want to do it's really not a big deal to me but if you want to go ahead and put those points into something else you can go ahead and do that your yourself if that's if that's your personal preference so then as far as my attributes go enough points in the strength to use my gear dexterity and the points using my gear I don't think there was any dexterity I need to put in and the rest of my points vitality and energy none this is not an energy shield build this is actually a build to do the maximum amount of damage that could possibly do so we're gonna go ahead and set the players to eight real quick and I'm gonna show you guys how well this character works. and there you go it doesn't get any better than that guys I mean that kills speed is just absolutely ridiculous on any character I mean I don't think you're gonna be able to beat out that and then you're gonna be able to teleport around and do whatever you want to do in the game you can do bail runs you can do my fists oh you know you can go around the world and just kill whatever you want it's a lot different than playing other classes like a javelin Amazon as I said before we can't go around and just teleport to wherever you want to go so and then on this guy I'm doing 36 K up to 36 K lightning damage and up to 12 K Chain Lightning as far as my thunderstorm goes I mean that's doing 4 K damage per strike so that's actually pretty nice and that's actually a skill that was really popular back in the day during the more classic days of Diablo 2 and early lord of Destruction thunderstorm was actually one of the most powerful skills in the game and they would actually just one-shot people all the time in PvP so that's about it for this video guys make sure you subscribe useful and keep up with Diablo 2 content make sure you like this video and leave a comment in the comment section below and let me
