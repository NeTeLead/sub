 I guess what's up I'm Andy I'm a self-taught software developer and today's video is all about JavaScript it's a JavaScript primer video and what I mean by primer is we're going to take a 10,000 foot view of JavaScript explain what it is where you can find it what other software development community thinks about it and maybe why you should learn it I've had a lot of people ask questions about specific programming languages in previous videos and comments so I figured why not take some time to give sort of a overview of each programming language and so I'm creating this primer series now the ideal person you watch this is somebody who's just starting out who's a beginner who's brand-new to sort of software development or web development in general and that way I can kind of guide you sort of just tell you a little bit about what JavaScript does and maybe how it fits in all these sort of development software development universe all right so let's just get right into it what is JavaScript well why should we start here start with the Internet so JavaScript has been called the language of the web and the reason it's called the language of the web is because pretty much everywhere you go every website you visit will use JavaScript in some sort of meaningful way to make that web page dynamic let's take a very typical scenario of where you're going to your favorite website maybe it's I don't know and Easter quits calm or something like that but each website will serve up a few files but let's say it's a very basic scenario your your website's gonna serve up in index.html page and a script ideas page now the index up to HTML page is serving up basically HTML to the browser and HTML stands for hypertext markup language which just essentially means it's the it's telling the browser it's like the skeleton of the page right it's gonna tell the browser where to place different items it's gonna tell the browser what to show in terms of initial data in other words maybe it's got a title it's got a body paragraph etc etc but that HTML page is very limited in what it can do because it can really only show static meaning never changing day now by itself obviously that HTML page is nice and all you can show people with some information but by itself it's pretty limited in what it can do so say you wanted to grab information from a server say you wanted to grab information from Twitter and display some tweets some live tweets on your web page you can't do that alone with HTML like that doesn't have the built-in functionality to go out and do that that's where JavaScript JavaScript can come into play it can turn your static website your static HTML site into a dynamic site javascript is actually able to manipulate what is you are looking at on the website but being able to access the HTML Dom which is the document object model which basically is the programmatic sort of data that tells JavaScript what is not only on the page where it's currently the page looks like but it gives it access to change things on the page now that information that Dom information is available through an API which stands for application programming interface now really don't need to know what an API is other than it's sort of the opening to control some of the the things on the HTML page again that's something that you'll probably learn more when you actually decide you're gonna learn JavaScript beyond that javascript has loads of potential function I that you can use with it so in the example that I used the for accessing Twitter not only can you potentially access Twitter programmatically meaning if you you can connect to their API their application programming interface and access tweets directly you can also access a server that you are running where you can send it some information and it could send you information back and the work to connect to Twitter or whatever outside sort of data service that you need it can do the work server-side and return it to JavaScript but javascript has that functionality in it to sort of access web services process information it's really limited to your creativity of what you want to do with that you can even create a video game like I did for my first step which is here all right so we know that javascript is used to help make HTML pages dynamic but where else is it used it does not limit it to the browser there are so many places that's use now there's really a massive JavaScript universe the first place that most people who work with JavaScript may be familiar with is the area of web frameworks now web frameworks built with JavaScript are so common nowadays that the running joke is that there's a new sort of framework available every day and it's true there are tons of JavaScript frameworks it might have heard of angularjs react j/s backbone view is another one that's fairly recent and plenty more probably there's not anymore but a JavaScript framework essentially is a framework that helps people to or helps developers to build apps it does a lot of what you would call the heavy lifting of an application now each frameworks different but essentially many of them cover some of these sort of sort of things that you may want to do so things like routing in other words going from page to page of the application displaying different components of the app that's something that can be very tedious but that some of the frameworks will do for you another one is connecting to data services so connecting to your back-end servers serializing or deserializing the information being able to keep track of authentication and security tokens a lot of these frameworks make that a whole lot easier and it means you won't have to sort of roll or create your own framework or little module functionality for every app that you create now look the topic of JavaScript frameworks could really take its own videos so suffice to say that it is if you're gonna become a web developer it's gonna be something that you're gonna learn a lot about and something that you should probably learn about if you want to learn JavaScript Java scripts also available as a server-side language in nodejs which allows you to create a basically server-side functionality using javascript so you could have a potentially front-end with JavaScript and back in with JavaScript even more than that Java scripts available as a database language there are two that come to mind right away it's MongoDB and CouchDB that use JavaScript their programming language as well so really you could have a entire stack from front to back and be JavaScript you want to create a mobile app potentially well JavaScript actually allows you to do that as well I've actually used in the past I've used ionic which is a sort of framework that will allow you to create a mobile app using angular essentially and we'll take that and sort of how would you say it will create a mobile app for both Android and iOS that is sort of like it's it's it looks and feels like a mobile app but it's really just rendering sort of HTML and JavaScript now that's not the same as creating an iOS app in the native language but it can be sort of a substitute if you don't have a mobile developer and you can you can obviously access so it's definitely not the same as creating a mobile app but you can definitely get decently close to it and lastly you can actually create desktop apps using JavaScript HTML and CSS with a framework called electrons so you could create a sort of full-fledged desktop app that people can use on Windows I think I uh I'm pretty sure with iOS with using the electron framework so go ahead and check that out as well but essentially all you have to really know is that JavaScript really is being used a lot everywhere so it's moved far beyond its humble origins and the browser just manipulating sort of the the HTML on the page all right so now you know a little bit about how JavaScript works you know where it's used with question you might be thinking is why should I learn JavaScript that's a good question to ask I am a huge fan of JavaScript from the perspective of a first programming language I create a video here that has my top three programming languages and it is definitely number one the basis of my reasoning for that is that JavaScript is so simple to get up and running for a beginner so if you want to go on a start right now all you need is a text editor and a browser and you just start messing around with JavaScript all you really need is a browser and you can open up the developer tools and start working the console right away beyond that there are I think javascript is a syntactically the syntax of the language is pretty easy to pick up for beginners so you add those two reasons it is not a perfect program in language so there are some quirks with it and I think that there are a number of good programming languages to learn as a beginner for the first time I just happen to pick JavaScript it's by no means the best so don't worry if you pick Python or something else with c-sharp or Java they're all great languages to learn but it's just my personal recommendation the next question to ask is what does a software development community think about javascript javascript is surprisingly a very polarizing language now there it's so widely used now it's so massively adopted by you know tons of companies are using JavaScript web frameworks they're using you know JavaScript as a server-side language would node as a back-end you know as a database I should say so people have really bought into JavaScript but there's no doubt that and so a lot of people love it but there's no doubt that there's a lot of hatred towards it because well let's put it this way if you've been programming JavaScript for any amount of time there you will encounter some of the most frustrating things ever from all the way from naming so capitalization issues so say you name a variable and E and you lowercase it and then when you go to you find it it's a different case it will break your application it can be almost impossible to figure out why it demand you know the complexity of your application but there are so many little sort of gotchas and weird quirks about the language that many people honestly just don't like I work also in the c-sharp so I work on the backend language and that's a strongly typed language meaning that any sort of errors and the syntax are strict there are if you forget a semicolon the entire application will not build into a an executable program that you can use JavaScript on the other hand is not like that at all javascript is an interpreted language that what means that the browser will simply read your JavaScript and even if there are errors it will not sort of tell you about it until it goes to actually run the code and then it realizes that hey there's a missing bracket or semicolon or something like that so it can be a little bit more frustrating for developers and so that's why people will give it a lot of criticism at the end of the day it's widely adopted if the better program in the image for the browser comes along I'll happily adopt that but until then we've got JavaScript we've got a lot of frameworks and I don't know that's as far as I think about it alright so let's cover some commonly asked questions about JavaScript our Java and JavaScript the same Java and JavaScript are not the same despite the closeness of naming they are not the same at all javascript was actually its syntax was based off of Java which at the time of Java scripts creation was one of the hottest programming languages but just to some despite their namesake and despite I guess there's some other similarities and syntax they are absolutely not the same do not confuse the two they're completely separate languages do I need to know HTML and CSS before I start with any JavaScript the short answer would be no you don't really need to know HTML and CSS but the long answer is yes you definitely do because JavaScript can be run by itself right now I could have you open up a browser open up the developer tools and start you know messing around with JavaScript but javascript is complementary to HTML and CSS and if you're gonna become a JavaScript developer there's a good chance you're going to need to do web development in general meaning work with HTML and CSS so definitely you should learn HTML and CSS but one of the mistakes I sort of get a sense that people make when they want to hear that you have to learn HTML and CSS before learning JavaScript is that they have to somehow become masters at HTML and CSS my recommendation has always been the same learn the basics learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS be able to do a few things once you've picked up HTML CSS then move on to JavaScript you do not need to become master you do not need to come you know a wizard of HTML and CSS cuz that is you can potentially get really crafty with it and you don't have become very crafty to know how to use JavaScript to work with HTML CSS so don't don't break your back learning it but definitely learn it and then move on to JavaScript next question I wanna learn JavaScript what should I do that is a question for a whole nother video I really hate breaking down into like three steps that you should do to learn JavaScript but I learned JavaScript by reading the head first javascript book that was my introduction to it that's my recommendation I'll include a link to that in the description below but other than that I would say first learn JavaScript either use the head first book or tutorial online once you've sort of gotten a good grasp on JavaScript assuming by the way you've learned a little bit of HTML and CSS as well you're going to want to build a complex application by complex I mean complex and challenging for you not a said complex like you have to build the next Facebook but you're gonna build an app that is challenges your skills and that you can use in your portfolio eventually to to try and get jobs you can use as showing off sort of your skills say once you've built a an app or using JavaScript then it's probably a ton that a good time to learn a web framework such as angular react just go ahead and pick one it doesn't really matter just pick one of the more popular ones I'd say and then build another app and that once you're there then it's probably a good time to sort of evaluate your skills talk to you more probably want to get some sort of mentor in the field who's in the field who can give you a sense of where you should go next because once you've done all that you're you've done a pretty good job and you know JavaScript to a decent degree and it's time for the next challenge which you can probably figure out at that point and one more note to just real quick about the headfirst javascript book before I forget if you are going to do that book which I highly recommend because it's a great sort of anti textbook right like it's not a dry and boring textbook which is gonna make you hate programming I highly recommend that you do every single activity don't be that person who thinks you're like too good to you know do all the little dorky activities but those activities are there for you to sort of cement in your learning and I recommend that book all the time and I just I always have to put that caveat in there because it's super important to make sure that everybody's doing all that so if you decided to get the book do all the activities alright so that is it for my JavaScript primer video what did you think about that did I answer all of your burning questions about JavaScript do you genuinely feel that I covered enough of it to help you to understand sort of the you know again the 10,000 foot view of JavaScript if you didn't please let me know in the comments I'm totally serious I love to hear your feedback I want to make really good videos in the future I'm gonna be making more primer videos on different programming languages so please give me that
