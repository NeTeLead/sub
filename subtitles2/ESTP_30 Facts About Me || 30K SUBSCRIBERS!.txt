 hey guys what is up welcome back to another video what am i doing. [Music] as you guys can tell by the title today's video is pretty exciting because I have just hit 30 thousand subscribers yeah this is really exciting and I thought I would do something a little bit different I've never done one of these videos before actually I thought I would give you guys 30 facts about me so you can get to know me a little bit better okay so I do have my computer here because I would not be able to come up with 30 facts about me on the spot so here we go I was born in Holland I was born in a little town like 20 minutes north of Amsterdam it's a pretty big tourist attraction actually because it's Holland's best known fishing village the town is like right on the water there's a lot of boats the best fish you've ever had in your life is there I'm 22 years old I'm five nine a lot of people ask me about my height actually my birthday is November 23rd I am a Sagittarius I love the zodiac my son sign is Sagittarius my moon sign is a Taurus and my rising is a Scorpio I have four younger brothers you guys would have probably seen them if you guys have watched my Canada vlogs and my Christmas vlogs and stuff you guys would have seen a few of them running around something that might shock you I always think this is a really cool thing to tell but I'm actually part Indonesian my whole dad's side of the family is Indonesian my grandpa was born there and he moved to Holland when he was a teenager and you can see like in my dad and even in my brother's you can see it a lot more than you can see it on me we obviously look like siblings but we also look very different from one another I speak fluent Dutch I can read it I can write it I can speak it and then obviously English I did take French and Spanish when I was in high school but unfortunately like I can't keep it up so technically I'm Canadian by Passport I became a Canadian citizen when I was 15 I was in the tenth grade and yeah I've had a Canadian passport ever since I don't have a Dutch passport anymore my first trip as a model was actually to Tokyo I was 15 and I lived there for two months and this was actually while I was still in high school it was like the first semester of grade 11 so I was actually really scared of dogs for most of my childhood I was bitten by a dog when I was three I think three or four and I don't even remember being bitten by this dog but it clearly left me really traumatized because I couldn't I couldn't even be in a room with a dog crazy enough the only way that I was able to get over this fear was actually when we got a family dog and that wasn't until I was like 15 or 16 I actually still get a little bit scared around puppies because they can bite and I know it's just like puppy biting but still in my mind it's crazy how one incident as a kid can just leave you traumatized for most of your childhood another thing that you guys probably don't know about me is that I'm actually a really musical person music was a huge part of my childhood I played piano for like nine years and I sang for I took singing lessons I think for like seven or eight years I'd never did any like sports I never was any part of any school teams or anything like that but this was my after school thing it was music so I moved to New York when I was 17 I pretty much moved right after I graduated high school I spent that summer just working and saving up money and waiting for my work visa and then as soon as my work visa came in I booked my flight and I moved to New York in my final year of high school I actually did apply to university as a back-up plan just in case something crazy happened with my face or with my body and I wasn't able to go to New York I did want to have a back-up plan so I actually applied and I got accepted to three I got accepted to U of T Ryerson York those are all universities in downtown Toronto and I got accepted for a criminal psychology degree my guilty pleasure obviously I have like guilty pleasures that are food or guilty pleasures that are indulgence ins they my biggest guilty pleasure honestly waking up just as the Sun is rising getting up putting some clothes on getting coffee and going for a long walk just as the Sun is coming up I can juggle and I don't have anything to juggle with right now but before this video goes up I will insert a video of me juggling so I can prove it to you I. love coffee. and I don't just love it because it gives me energy I genuinely love the taste of coffee my favorite dessert is either ice cream or carrot cake carrot cake is like just my all-time favorite cake or apple pie oh my god how could I forget about apple pie yeah those three are like my favorite desserts my favorite holiday is probably New Year's just because you get to celebrate everything you've accomplished that year I love the start of a new year you know it's like a brand new year it's a clean slate you have so many possibilities opportunity for improvement all that stuff I really want to be a mom in the future definitely not anytime soon probably like eight or ten years down the line even though I'm very outgoing and very energetic as a person I actually spend a lot of time alone I just I love being alone I love working on my own stuff I love being able to do my own thing that's also why I live alone it was literally the best thing in the entire world oh my gosh so I will wake up in the middle of the night and I think that I'm fully awake basically but I'm actually sleep drunk and I would grab my phone in the middle of the night and like check if I have any messages or something and then if I do I will respond to them and then in the morning I will realize that I was actually asleep drunk Wow replying to these messages so sometimes I will have responded to someone in the middle of the night and I wake up in the morning and I read it and it makes no sense like I listen to music all day long all day long I have either in my ear pods or just playing off my computer or my phone I mostly listen to offer beats and hip hop in that order I've actually never broken any bones knock on wood I do actually have a little bit of OCD this is in like two ways it's mostly like everything does have its spot and everything everything has to be organized and clean if there's like clothes everywhere I can't do it there will never be a time that I have like clothes lying on the floor clothes all my bed unless I'm like doing laundry before I can do anything else everything has to be in its spot everything has to be cleaned up otherwise I just can't put all my energy on whatever I'm like supposed to be doing so that is my first OCD thing and then my second main OCD thing is actually having things in stock. so if you guys will watch my vlogs you'll probably have seen that I have a huge collection of paper towels and toilet paper above my kitchen cabinets and that just that's usually stocked up at all times but same comes to toothpaste mouthwash moisturizer any type of cream any type of makeup remover cotton pads I have one or more of everything storage thing down here yeah cool I am an e SF jey the only reason I'm putting this in here is because I did a little QA or something on my Instagram and a lot of people ask me if I've done the Mayers Briggs test so I'm an e SF jey if you guys don't know what myers-briggs is you should definitely check it out and see what your personality type is never donated drugs never smoked anything I had braces I had braces for my D I had them for just under a year when I was 13 one of my biggest dreams and this doesn't necessarily have a time limit on it but something that I will do and I say will because I know that I'm gonna do this is I really want to start my own foundation like a charitable organization it's gonna be something to do with kids kids who are less fortunate kids who don't have a stable family environment something something along those lines that's one of my biggest life goals is to be able to do good for kids so guys that is gonna be it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it I hope you guys learned something new about me that you didn't know before
