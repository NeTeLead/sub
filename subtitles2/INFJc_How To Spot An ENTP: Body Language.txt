 hey everyone the name is Erick door and I think new personality type loves analyzing other people as much as entp personality type I've leave no type is more interested in studying people and their body language and their quirks and their behavior and kind of what game they're playing I think the INTP tends to assume everyone is playing a game everyone is out to get something everybody wants something so I think E&T piece they like figuring out what it is that people want and how people want it now this video is aimed at undressing the INTP and helping you read ENT peepers not the type and also understand some of their giveaway quirks and some of their core interests and values what I believe is everyone has a set of body language habits that are related to their core values and their core interests you can read it in their face their tone of voice their body language and their gestures and how they interact and how they use and engage in and show their emotions outwardly so I don't believe anybody can read a person's type based on facial features how the shape of the eyes are or the size of the nose or anything like that i don't believe i believe that pseudoscience but i do believe that we have distinct ways mannerisms as distinct gaze a distinct way of thinking in a distinct way our feeling and experiencing life and our facial expressions and our body language mirror is that one core quirk I found was that extroverts tend to rather than pull information from inside out they tend to gather information from the world around them that's core sign you can see in their body language they will grab for information and you know the intp they have a very distinct mannerism as they do often first what you will notice is searching eyes you know in teepees they have searching eyes their eyes go like detectives they analyze the world around them their eyes are open and study us they read patterns they search for clues they investigate they analyze they think oh what's that and what's that how does those statements connect why did that person do that where are they going next what's gonna happen after this and you see that also in their their gestures because they're not just scrapping for data they're searching there their wrists are fluid in their motions as they grab information their wrists and fluid so they're searching for information around them and after what you want to look at what you want to focus on is also their finger motions because often the ntps precise finger motions often it's like they're calculating things as they use their hands and that's the gesture their fingers move in calculated and precise manners they love accuracy they like knowing exactly what's going on exactly how something happens they love to count and to get clues from the information reading them information reading their environment pragmatically looking for objective data and insight you know the in PT P likes to formalize you know what is that they know how what data do they have what information do they have what are the statistics what do the numbers say you know how often does something happen you know how often is something tend to happen what tends to happen if you use that much of that so they're often the approaching life as you know Street mathematicians you know rather than sit on their own and calculate and think and ponder or something theoretically they like to text the test and experiment and try things out you know here's I'm gonna reveal one of the coolest the most interesting in type emotions you know E&T peas have dancing eyes their eyes tends to dance as they're a go to go over information and data their eyes tend to move in fluid and seemingly random patterns but it's all of course orchestrated in a way it's all in a sense a symbol of curiosity and options and what-ifs what if that what if that what if that what if this what if that you know go going over and thinking about different things that could happen could come to me and you know after what you'll see here is like the inventors spark you know the inventors spark is one of the key entp signals it's like when they realize something when they have an how I figure something out and you see especially in the outer part of their eyes how their eyes shine out you know in deep Easton's have adaptive and open eyes eyes that study and take in gather and study and take in more and more information more and more data so what you see is when they realize something or when they spot something or they notice something they seem so curious you know they have stitched natural curiosity to them this marvelous fascination with what's going on with figuring something out and you know there's no more INTP expression than that oh and you figure something out and you go like what really it started stat how it works together when you really connect the pieces and you add it all up and all the numbers make sense and it's like yeah yeah that's shake shake shake shake check you go through a list yeah it's alright that's all correct it all seems to be true and here you know what you'll notice is in teepees they tend to have very round facial expressions you know all their expressions than to start in outer parts of their face it's like it's like an openness that starts in the outer parts of a jaws their smiles start in the sheikhs there's expressions start very much in outer parts of the face and then come in words often what you notice is you know yours they don't have very precise looks they don't look straight at something they're very much focused but the ent patents have opened us so that's a very not natural part of entp body language you can also hear it in their voice and in how they talk and express themselves it's it's a cool and objective voice it's a pragmatic voice it's a strong voice ent pieces are very strong voices you know even in teepees talk they command authority and attention and a lot of people miss this body in teepees intps are very power oriented types they are very much aware of power dynamics in the group who's a head who's in charge who leads and you know Ian's teepees don't have a natural desire towards leadership and to be in charge or not necessarily to have the responsibility of being in charge but to be the one people listen to and to be the person who initiates and catalyzes action and gets everyone moving so they like to be able to be the one ahead and so that their voice they tend to command authority respect that's something they deeply need and deeply appreciate being able to feel listen to being able to feel heard and being able to feel that you have a power and say in life and in life's matters and in the group so often it it is that intps tone of voice s naturally enthusiastic and it's naturally rhythmic Eric McCall it jumps the darts from point to point it's than that and then this and then that it's going over and checking through different lip parts of a list it's where have this and then we have that and then we have this and then we have that it's going over data it's a voice that also indicates kind of game that there is a game going on there is some kind of. power dynamic at play there is different aspect to think about we can take this route or we can take that routes you know and that route has that advantage in that route I started volunteering if we go there maybe we can get this and that and that but if we go there maybe we have a problem with this you know Mabel this will come up or maybe that will come up so you know in teepees they're very good at reading risks you know and spotting when something is going to get them somewhere and when something is going to present a problem for them they are very good anticipating the consequences of actions and noticing when something is gonna leave in a bad way and when something is not an INTP is they are very tactical people you know often they like to be the one that counters the moves of others they like to argue without people they like to bring counter-arguments yeah you say this but then if you say that then there's this problem or that issue so unity peace they like to focus on and study what other people are doing first you know they have very studious expressions they analyze everyone they like to know what people are doing and then when people are doing something they like to intercept this and either bring support through logical aid or to bring criticism or arguments that can help steer things in the right direction so often they come from the perspective of fixing things and correcting things if somebody says something that is wrong the INTP has to decide correct a mistake if there is an alternative the INTP has a desire to bring up this alternative and show that you yeah you can go here but you can also go there and that's probably faster and then you're gonna get there much more in time so the NTP is searching expression and also curious expression they have also kind of a defiance or a rebellion in the rise you know it looks like they they cannot they can take the role or the archetype of the contrary in a society often yeah but there's a better way to do things or defiance as in yeah you're not gonna control me or you're not gonna be able to use me I'm gonna be a rabble I'm gonna go against the flow I'm gonna defy the norms and that's an important part of the entity that rebellious Ness and their ability to go against the flow so intps they're deeply fascinating people a lot of my patreon sorry in DPS and a lot of people who come to watch this channel and support it or any piece a lot people are very curious to learn more because they yeah they won't understand the mannerisms of their own type and they also want to understand others and I notice that int peace are some of the most interested in other personality types than their own they're deeply curious about how other people work and how about group dynamics and relationships between different people in the group and who's and whose what type is better at what and what skills and abilities different types have so something yet recognized in the NTP is that need for a potential you know what is it I could do what I said I could be what is it I could achieve so the question I usually get for me in two pieces you know what should I do what career should I get where what should I do how should I get there what strategy should I use you know what should I study you know and I think for the NTP the good answer is almost everything study almost anything you can get your hands on you know no information is bad information you are meant to be an inventor first and foremost you know a person of great ideas and great possibilities and creativity one that brings things to fruition and so on that puts out new ideas one who corrects and innovates in the world and brings out new things one of the most important exercises as an INTP I believe is looking yourself in the mirror you know when you wake up and seeing that creative spark seeing those searching eyes seeing that desire for power and that desire for accuracy and for skill and ability in yourself in your facial expressions in your smiles in you decide analyze things you know noticing all those qualities are there and holding on to that flow and that energy and that motivation and making the best out of it asking yourself what is that I'm searching for what is what are the ideas that I have before me what are my options and what they said I could improve were fixed so what is that I could invent or come up with what solutions could I make or design you know how could I impact the world what in what ways could I influence the world differently and how can I make the world a better place that's what you have to recognize you know what I said I want first and foremost don't become so detached to assume that you don't want anything or that you don't need anything but rather observe yourself as you observe other people analyze yourself as you analyze other people use your own skills just as you can use the skills of other people to make the world a better place so that's it on intp part language if you have found any quirks of the NTP that you like to talk about feel free to share them in the comments below thanks everyone for watching and I hope to see you guys in the next video
