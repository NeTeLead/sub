 do you know that the last time you have the better it actually is I was at this conference clickfunnels and russell brunson from the stage he was talking bad he had like a month to make a million dollars and he never made 1 million dollars before but because he was running out of money he had this deadline and he either goes bankrupt in a month or he makes this million he did everything and he made a million this is why I'm all about acting fast and I actually love them short of deadlines because if you're telling yourself I want to make a million in the next year then you're like taking three months soft and the other quarter you're figuring out your idea and then the next quarter you're trying to launch it and by the last quarter of the year you understand that this is not actually the idea that you wanted to go with but if you acted faster if you execute it in a couple days you would have known that this idea will work but maybe another idea I've been modified idea work so this video is about tips on how to start a business in two or three days test out your idea interested continue watching [Music]. did you know how we got our first client I was 21 years old back in the University and I didn't have any company back then I didn't have any experience but we just started telling people that we're starting this company and you know people are genuinely interested when somebody starts doing something and they want to watch your progress so we're like yeah you know we're like thinking of the concept building the web said whoa whoa and then just one of our classmates was like I wanted to go and study languages abroad would you guys help me and we're like yeah of course already doing this thing she was our first client and we like ran and registered the company but this is this happen really fast we didn't have a website we didn't have not we had nothing zero we just started telling people that we're doing this thing and this is how the first customer came about yes this is that easy just you know no social media no nothing just start telling your circles that you're doing something and yes you have to be better see purely because b2c business to customer it's easier to sell consumer products to your surrounding but if you're doing like a SAS like solution for it companies you would need a go to like events and conferences and just start telling people that you're doing this thing you don't have to necessarily have it you just have to have the idea you need a sound confident you need to well start a company is something that you really know and then you know when you have your first line you're gonna worry about like registering and stuff I think this is a really sane approach and it really helped us to start number two if you want to sell a physical product again yes you can go all fancy you can go and you know create thousands of those products spend hours and hours on thinking about the design and best materials and stuff but if it doesn't sell this is all worthless so what you need to try doing right now is actually set up your own shop create an offer create a product maybe like a small batch and try selling it because if you don't sell twenty you wouldn't sell a hundred and sometimes people just you know this type of people and I'm afraid that more and more people are like that they're like you know they want to start a YouTube channel they haven't even filmed their first video but they're already getting all the cameras and mics and all of the expensive stuff and then they create their first video and they're like yeah maybe this is not my thing yeah this is really not my thing but they've spent all of this money already my approach is always this I call this entrepreneurial approach for like business my approach when you start with zero when you start from scratch investing nothing just your expertise just you know maybe small amount of money we invest like 300 if you're creating a physical product yes you would need that physical product but you don't need the rest like it is so easy to be websites for smaller shops it's so easy to handle all the online sales right now with all the tools and this video is brought to you by Volusion the company that actually helps you sell products online and I'm gonna tell you a little about it because if you're thinking of launching an actual product

get 80% off any business level plan and test your idea straight away just imagine one place you're gonna create your landing page you're gonna start accepting transactions if you would make any sales you would just ship through that platform it's that easy you don't need a developer you don't need a storage you don't design it or like nothing you just start and test if it goes amazing if it doesn't work then you will switch to something else this is what it takes just start a business tip number three if you are trying to sell something that is intangible like an online course or maybe a service my best strategy to testing it out is actually creating a small landing page where you would give people something for free for example what I would do if I wanted to market my use of course for example I would create a checklist with top ten topics that go viral on YouTube no matter what I would create this list and give it for free to people who give me their emails and I would create a Facebook ad or like a Google ad that would target people and I would just follow them everywhere with like hey you're stuck with a YouTube channel want to make another viral video here are my top ten ideas to create a viral video there's a link below leave your email you're gonna get this list bah blah and then what I'm gonna do next cuz when you're selling a service and people don't know you I just think you don't have any social media or something you need a really build trust and this is the way you build trust you give them something for free they look at your list and they're like ah maybe she understands something in YouTube maybe I should you know try and follow her advice and they download your list you get their email the next email coming from you and you can automate all of that but you can just do it manually the next day you send them like hey you haven't started YouTube channel yet here's my top three tips on starting YouTube channels in 2019 and tell them a little about yourself like hey I do this this and that amazing and then the second email you send them again be useful give them so useful information and then with the letter number three you can start selling by the way if you haven't sir youtube channel there is my course signup giving you exclusive 30 percent discount whatever in this way you're able to save a lot of money on Facebook ads because if you're just starting at people with your product if you're just starting it down with your service they would be like huh I don't know that person I don't know that if I can trust them and they would click but then they will drop off and if you don't have like a lead capture thing on your website which you probably don't then they will just go away so they would need an incentive to become your lead and this free product free checklist or whatever can be that thing so try that and your CTR is gonna be really high your conversions are gonna be really good and then it's up to you how you're gonna sell your product but this is the way to test out the idea are people interested in starting a YouTube channel maybe not like go ahead and test and it takes two or three days and tip number four something that works for me something that works for all of my companies social media again being useful for people create an account with your expertise give them value and by the way maybe you have some followers in social media maybe you have your Facebook fans or like friends do you have an Instagram friends you know what's the best way to test to your idea is don't ask them like oh my god guys if I created this this and that would you buy for me of course I can tell yes of course go ahead sounds interesting but would they really buy you don't know they need to vote with their cash with real money so what are you gonna do you're gonna create a post where you're gonna tell people I've just launched this course it costs $59.99 I'm giving it to you for $39.99 just today you have 12 hours to pay and you see how many payments come through and you know you can always refund those famous or you can tell them hey okay I'm gonna deliver in a week we just fine and you will have time to create a product just think of a product that you can create it within a week this is the only way to test because if you just sell again if you tell your mom hey mom what do you think I'm gonna sell this online company teaching people to start YouTube it won't be like yeah that's amazing this for you no matter what you do that would be amazing yeah this is not testing your idea my idea of testing is actually coming up with an offer coming up with a price see how people pay like make them pay and then make a decision where you want to proceed with that or not that wasn't for me for today guys I hope you're gonna use my principle of starting as soon as possible because a lot of your ideas that you think are genius ideas amazing ideas are actually not and or maybe when you start bringing them to life you realize there's so many things that you forgot to think about that it's actually impossible at this stage of your life so try and test as fast you can my challenge for you is start a business in today's like go ahead do it let me tell Co it's below if you're gonna do it I mean this is the only way to start cuz he's been years oh I wanted to tell you this story I had a friend was like I want to quit my corporate job I'm gonna start a business I'm gonna take this year off and what she ended up doing is just you know she thought that if she takes this corporate life away from her life she's gonna get a lot more energy on actually thinking about her idea but what she was a she was just thinking about it she wasn't really testing she was just researching you like talking to people which is not bringing this to market and by the end of her one year sabbatical she realized that she didn't come up with any distant idea and she's now back in her corporate world which is not a bad thing but the initial purpose was to become an entrepreneur and entrepreneurs are people who test very quickly and he need another inspiration watch my interview with Alex Muir he
