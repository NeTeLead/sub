 hello I'm Alexa and you should know today is my birthday and I love birthdays [Music]. [Music]. I don't know about you but my ear ends and he gets a hyper exciting short years is a great time of the year to pick holes and attentions but I like to use my birthday as a moment to reflect on what I've learned and every year since I turned twenty four years old I've cleaned up with the past years meant to me this year helped me realize I need to work on my self-confidence and what's this year's theme personal responsibility it's been a fascinating experience and I'd encourage you to did Sam [Music]. this pastors name became really clear to me over the last few months which i think is summarized quite nicely in this Shakespeare quote there's nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so there are a lot of reasons why it could be sad mad frustrated or angry the world is a brutally unfair play sometimes but what if the pain wasn't bad but if it just was or what if you saw the pain as experienced and as a challenge to be better now that's good right so here's the thing I live in San Francisco and I love it here so much I moved here in 2012 and it changed my life the people I met the places I visited the things I've created were all inspired by the city I'm so grateful for it and although I love San Francisco it can be a challenging place to live sometimes there's the expensive cost of living a growing homeless population there's trash all over the place and when it comes to important political issues people tend to be quite partial in their thinking and then there's the dating scene oh my god dating here has been really hard for me it was so challenging that I decided to make an Instagram ad with my friend Kevin so we could more actively search for things did you see it oh hey I'm Kevin so we both make youtube videos and I found that amazing things happen when you put yourself out there so we were wondering how we can apply this for our daily lives and then BOOM walk anyway all I'm trying to say is that life is hard and that's okay in fact I think it's great and I wouldn't have it any other way maybe was a bad date like a really bad date or someone who yelled at you on the bus maybe it was a way someone spoke to you at school or at work or I don't know your roof collapsed your plants died you spilled food on your shirt whatever it is it's these moments that a surface-level feel bad but if we sit you're thinking it could be used to help us feel better over the long run these moments make us better and this year I've learned to understand that at a much deeper level it's hard to explain and I've listened to people talk about this idea like a lot because if you're gonna blame people for all the you better blame them for all the good till if you're gonna give them credit for everything that's up there faizon credit for everything that's great if we can realize that life is always happening for us not to us. game over all the pain of suffering disappears but there's a difference from hearing it to then when you start to notice how it shows up in your everyday life like in an energetic sort of way the mind is seriously incredible so every bad date that's an experience every disagreement with a friend or a family member even a stranger just experience every time I drank more alcohol than I should have and realized it in the morning that's just experience every missed bus ride every bad grade every misstep just experience it's a call to be better next time and in that moment it just is what it is so today I turned 28 years old and this is what I know now I hope you have a great day and then I see you next time bye you don't know me I make videos about product design careers in tech and life in San Francisco if you enjoyed this video you should be a subscriber it's also my birthday and that would be an awesome birthday gift I'm also super active on Instagram so why don't you go on over there and give me a quick hello I've got time. all right bye it's
