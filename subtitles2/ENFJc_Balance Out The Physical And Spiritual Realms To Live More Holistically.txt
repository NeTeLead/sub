month five dollars a month whatever you guys prefer in this video I really wanted to speak to you guys about the root chakra now I don't know I'm sure most of you guys don't believe in chakras chakras are worth texas of energies in our bodies there are seven major ones and then there's a few hundred thousand other ones that are minor ones but these are our textures of energy and a lot of yoga is based on really clearing out and energizing these chakras or balancing them out basically now one of the main chakras that I'm always working on as an infj as an introvert as an individual on this planet that is completely losing its grounding we're basically killing the ground that we live on what is happening is that we really need to focus or at least I'm spending a lot of time my time focused on the root chakra right I'm really spending a lot of time grounding myself doing yoga poses that are related to the root chakra it's called mooladhara and ul-adha ra but if you want to google root chakra you're obviously welcome to do that which I will show up as well and there's a lot of yoga asanas a lot of yoga poses that will focus on that but in general any kind of grounding anything that you're grounding yourself to the earth where you're walking in on the earth also barefoot really helps being in nature really house meditating if you're meditating with your body body and that really helps but the reason I wanted to do this video particularly is that I'm noticing this weird trend and spiritual people that I really I really that really irks me that makes me feel like they're kind of missing the point of the whole situation perhaps I'm the one in the wrong but I really feel like when I look at them and I feel like they're completely imbalanced I really feel like they should look at themselves and figure out okay what am I doing wrong here so a lot of the things I notice a lot and people is that once we discovered that you know we can meditate and and do lucid dreaming or we can do all these things with our a generic over that third eye or with our crown chakra and we can go onto into all these different realms we can you know you can transport ourselves into different dimensions a lot about doing a lot of cool things with their meditations once spiritual people cannot discover that especially if they're able to add into the mix mushrooms or ayahuasca ceremonies or some kind of hallucinogen like that or some kind of medicine plant medicine like that people discover special people especially they'll discover very fast that there is this whole new dimensional and realm around us that we're not privy to we can't even see it I'm sitting here right now I'm in the physical world and there's all this stuff going on around me in the other dimensions in the other color forms in the other sound forms that I am NOT I can't access but as a spiritual person or as a person that kind of experiments with all that stuff a lot of these individuals will discover all these other realms all these other places all these others other beings all those things and all of a sudden you realize that the physical realm that we living is kind of quite boring and actually really annoying because over here in the physical realm you have to focus on paying the bills you have to focus on working in the corporate system or in some kind of work making money and you know cleaning your house and doing laundry and all that stuff while you're thinking to yourself Wow all this amazing stuff exists in all these other realms if I meditate I can access them or if I do all these other things why am i focusing on all of this shitty crappy stuff in the real physical realm why can't I just live all of my life in that other room and so I noticed a lot of spiritual people kind of pushing away the physical realm or giving up on the physical realm not wanting to be in the physical realm no I wanting to worry about bills are taking care of themselves physically not caring about food or water or hygiene or anything about that and then just focusing all of their time and energy on that spiritual realm and I disconnect obviously from the physical realm is really causing a lot of unground and a lot of no dissipation are we getting away from your root chakra away from all of that grounding that is necessary for a human being to survive on this planet so I noticed that not only do a lot of spiritual people have this imbalance in them but also what happens is that they don't have enough money to take care of their bills though so they're you know they're they're begging on the street we call them backpackers you know they're begging on the street are they begging from locals in Asian countries who are apparently who have no money at all and that makes me really laugh or you know they don't have money so they're kind of begging from their friends like you know can you let me stay for free or can you pay for my bills or things like that or they're finding someone who can pay for their bills I could sugar daddy or sugar mama or things like that and so I noticed that there's this disconnect there they just want to be taken care of in the physical realm they don't want to be worrying about it so that they can just focus entirely on the spiritual realm a lot of that a lot of them will kind of move into an ashram and start doing all that so that they don't have to worry about the physical realm but I always think to myself you know yeah you can go away for a little bit you can leave the physical around perhaps for a few days months maybe even a few years but eventually I feel like you have to come back to it because hah I just feel like it's such an impossibility to completely disappear and completely run away from the physical realm I don't know if I even want to do that I always say to people I like living in the physical realm I do spend a lot of my time meditating and you know lucid dreaming or triangle lucid dream I'm trying to do all those things I love spending time in those other realms and other dimensions it's so much fun but I always love also coming back into the physical realm and using my senses and the touch touching a beautiful fabric or eating a delicious food a delicious piece of food or delicious sweet piece of fruit that I've never had before are smelling beautiful sense of Rose or jasmine or walking on the earth on the ground in the beautiful nature and noticing the trees and the flower is the beautiful flowers that are in Chiangmai I love it so I just love being in the physical realm and use my physical senses and being alive here yeah of course it's a little bit annoying at times when I have to do laundry when I rather be meditating or when I have to work when I rather be you know just sitting around doing nothing or all of those things of course I understand there there's a lot of annoyances associated with being in the physical realm but it is part and parcel of what I believe is really about being a human it is yes for spiritual beings and yes we are also physical beings but we also have to kind of combine the two and become the perfect version of both I think it's not just possible I believe at least this is my opinion I don't think it's just possible for us to spend all of our time in the physical realm or all of our time in the spiritual realm some people are way too physical you know they don't believe there's anything beyond the physical and that is also a weird way to look at the world where there's evidence that there is there are the things out there there are other beings out there are the spirits things like that so I think just one or the other can be a little bit too confusing as a human being because we are of both we are we have the physical flesh we have the physical body and we have the spiritual body we have the soul we have the spirit we have all of those things that make us who we are completely a whole so if we need to access at least in my opinion we need to access both of those realms in order to be a complete human being but what happens as I said is either the spiritual people are way too spiritual and have no idea how to ground themselves and then lose their ground and completely have no idea to come back to the real earth to the real ground they don't know how to take care of themselves in the physical realm they don't know how to make money so they're always relying on other people they're always begging other people just take care of them they don't know how to just be in the physical around just be here and and use their senses or they just don't want to do it anymore they just want to spend all their time high on some kind of hallucinogen or some kind of mushroom or something like that and just be meditating all the time and just feel like that's such a weird and terrible way to live at least in my opinion now now of course different people have different opinions of it but my my striving I'm always striving to match the two like I want to live in the physical realm I love it love it I also love the spiritual em I love it love it love it I love both I love both of them equally and that's the reason why and I started my days off with meditation but I also start off my days with yoga right so I'm using both I'm physically grounding myself I'm using a lot of root chakra awesome that's a lot of yoga poses that focus on the root chakra really ground myself down but then I do the meditation as well yeah so I balance each other out I spend a lot of my days eating a lot of delicious food and working in the real world and making money but then I spent a lot of my time trying to get to do sit dreaming and then trying out different ceremonies like ayahuasca plan medicine cacao mushrooms and all that stuff because I want to balance it all out I love both aspects of being a human and I want to explore both aspect as much as possible as as diligently as I can in this short life that I have I want to explore both of those sides I don't want to just focus on one I don't want just focus on the other I just want to be on both sides as much as possible so that's my feel on this maybe this is kind of like a rant or a rant but I just really want to share this with you because I believe it's so important at least from my opinion from what I see going in I think this is one of the main things that I want to focus on is the balance between the two of course if you guys have any comments on this I'd love to hear from you guys and if you guys are interested in supporting me further you're more than welcome to do that by going to my patreon site the link is in the description below and I shall see you guys all next time bye for now
