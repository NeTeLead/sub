 hi everyone so today I I would finally share with you my testimony video of how I got Who I am today a big part of who I am is my faith in God and so I ask that if you don't believe what I believe please be respectful and kind to one another because I hope that my channel can be a place where people are real and open and honest while feeling safe at the end of the day we are all humans who have been through a lot who go through difficult things in this life and you know we all need love and support and care so with that here's my story I would say that my life could be summed up in three different phases phase one was when I was this goody-goody Christian girl who never wanted to do anything wrong phase two was I didn't care anymore I rebelled and I did whatever I wanted I was running as far as I could without even knowing where I was going phase three was the aftermath and realizing and embracing that I am a child of God and that there was nothing that could take that away from me and with all three phases something that has always kind of loomed over my life and my family has been financial issues finances have really played a big part in Who I am today so there's a lot of things that I've happened where I just thought wow haha life is really difficult. [Music]. my family and I started going to church since I was six years old and pretty much my entire childhood I tried to be this goody-goody who always listened to everyone we tried to make everyone happy and I would pray every single night and I remember I couldn't even go to sleep unless I prayed because I just felt like I needed to talk to God and if I did it and I forgot I felt like oh my gosh what if God gets mad at me and then I don't get to go to heaven so that was pretty much how I always thought was I need to do good and be a good person and then I get to go to heaven and be with Jesus so in middle school I was the Christian club president and most of my friends were a part of the club and I was just kind of you know do many short Bible studies and it was just as part of my life where I just always tried to be good and my dad didn't let me have a boyfriend until I was 18 years old and so even if I had crushes on people or if we like like liked someone I couldn't really do anything about it because I listen to my dad as much as I could it wasn't until high school I started realizing that my parents might be struggling financially because my parents started asking to borrow money from me and I didn't have a job at the time I had just saved pretty much everything I had ever gotten from a relative and I would just you know save it in a little pocket that I made I decided to get a job I got a job at Ben & Jerry's ice cream and that was the first job I ever had I also got my license when I was fifteen and a half so I pretty much did everything the second that I could but I didn't have enough money for a car so then I went to his high school that had 4,000 students and I joined the Christian Club and I became a small group leader where I was in charge of you know holding some people accountable and you know praying for people and inviting my friends it was just a very safe bubble that I lived in and most of my friends actually went to church as well and so every Saturday we had youth group and on Sundays we would go to church now it's just kind of my safety net and then my senior year of high school hit and that's where everything just kind of fell apart in my life I got my first boyfriend and I was 17 and a half at the time and so I had about six months before I could tell my dad and all of his friends were partying and drinking and you know going out every weekend my circle of friends started diving into that as well and so I just felt very confused and I felt like I needed to participate and I was also very curious about it because it just seemed like you know I'm not supposed to be doing this but everyone seems to be having so much fun and I don't want to miss out so I'm going to do it too my parents are also never home because they were always working and so I just felt like my friends for now my life and then my senior year of high school I had my new boyfriend my friends were all partying my parents got their car impounded so I remember one morning my mom was supposed to take me to school and we saw the truck and they came to take the car and I begged the person can my mom just take me to school can I did she just drive the car to school and then you could take the car and he said no and so I started crying and I thought this is so embarrassing how am I gonna go to school and then the person said he would take me to school in the you know tow truck even then I went to school crying my eyes out because my parents had their car taken away because they couldn't make payments thereafter I just thought I need to work harder I needed you know work more for I was going to graduate from high school trying to open my door and I couldn't get in and I talked about this in my fiction video but basically my family and I got evicted and my dad wasn't able to pay the rent for five months and I know you might be thinking how can someone not pay for five months well I see it as what a blessing that I had a place to live for those five months considering they really could have kicked us out earlier typically with evictions what happens is you get kicked out and the Landlord wants the money that you owe them and then you you just kind of settle it but we didn't have any money and so I didn't know what to do and I was like oh my gosh I'm graduating soon and I was crying and I just thought God why would he do this to me like why would you do this to my family and my mom's friend helped us and so we were able to stay in like a motel until we were able to move again I decided to go to UC Riverside because they gave me a pretty darn good financial aid package and UC Riverside is where I really lost who I was as a person long gone were the days of this goody goody two-shoes Christian girl and here came this really lost person who felt like God had just abandoned me and I felt like if God was so good then why do all these bad things keep happening in my life I'm getting kicked out of your house and not get being able to get inside and having to borrow my friends clothes because I couldn't get my own clothes it was pretty traumatizing so I went off to college you know partying and doing whatever I could to fill this void I had in my heart and I just felt so unstable as a person and so how could you have a stable relationship when I myself was feeling very insecure inside and so we were we broke up probably like five or six times over and over again because I didn't know what I was doing and he didn't know what he was doing so that was really intense and after the first breakup I was completely depressed I thought that's something that would last forever didn't and I just felt like I I can't even begin to describe depression it's pretty much like you just don't care anymore you don't care about anything and I would wake up every day and just I wouldn't I couldn't wait until my day was over and so to get my day over with I would take naps and I would sleep for a very long time so I would sleep for about 14 hours and then I would take a two to three hour nap during the day as well I tried to go to some of my classes but sometimes I would just skip them and I just wouldn't care I also didn't eat and so I turned anorexic without even realizing I was anorexic because I was never hungry so I would eat a cracker in the morning and that would be it didn't have energy for anything then came a really dark point in my life like I just didn't see a purpose in living anymore and I just felt like God had really just forgotten about me so I didn't really feel the need to continue my life so going through all of that I didn't even realize that I was depressed and suicidal and anorexic it seems like when you're in the thick of it you don't even you can't even see it for yourself of what kind of situation that I'm in or I would just kind of be in denial of it which is pretty scary but thankfully you know I didn't act on it and one of the biggest reasons why I didn't is because I thought about my family and I thought about how heartbreaking would it be for my parents to know that that's how sad and depressed I was and I couldn't do that to them and so I had to get through the eternal struggles that I was wrestling with and I can't say that you know overnight it was just like BAM gone because it was something I had to go through it wasn't taken away I had to walk through the pain that I was feeling inside my junior year of college I joined a sorority I was a Delta Gamma it was I was surrounded by very sweet and sisters and I wasn't really partying that much anymore but I liked feeling like I belonged somewhere especially because I was I couldn't go to my church as often but then my dad went to Korea but then when he tried to come back into the country he was told that his green card had been revoked and the reason why we didn't get that notice is because the notice had come for him to show up to court back when I was a senior in high school when we got evicted and so we never got the mail it was this whole ordeal and this is where things get crazy so while my dad was in Korea my mom was struggling to pay the rent I was trying to help my parents but I also lived in Riverside where rent is very cheap but I couldn't pay for myself and my parents so I had two thousand dollars in my bank saving but two thousand dollars was for emergencies and I took it from my student loans it's not like I suddenly made and save two thousand it was from my student loans I borrowed more than I needed so that I can have something rather than nothing because there were times in college where I would eat brown rice and soy sauce because I didn't have money for anything else my dad was given the option to either go back to Korea and never come back to America or to be detained so of course he chose to be detained because if you leave that's it so my dad finally called my mom after they held him for about six hours and so she's at the airport wondering why my dad hasn't come out yet and they wouldn't let my dad call my mom until about six hours later and he finally told her I can't come out they are holding me and so then my mom calls me and I rush home thankfully by this time I had a car so I Drive home freaking out like my dad is going to jail what do I do we don't have money I try to talk to the immigration people and they were so mean and so rude and I was like I am a citizen you can't talk to me piss away the next day my mom and I had to look for an immigration lawyer and immigration lawyers are known to be very very expensive and the topic of immigration is very sensitive so I'm just going to just kind of give a brief spiel that my parents are both legal and they do have green cards my dad's green card got revoked due to some some financial lawyer thing that happened back when he wanted to file for citizenship and then there were some issues with that so I knew that the immigration lawyer would be expensive and all I had was $2,000 and I just thought well god you've kind of just poked me in this hole and I don't know what to do but we're just gonna I'm just gonna go to the lawyer and see what happens so in the morning I thought I'm gonna set up a GoFundMe and tell people what's going on on Facebook as embarrassing as it is as much as I don't like asking for help I feel like this is a situation where it's pretty darn extreme so I posted a GoFundMe and then within an hour I think I had about $100 in in donations and I told my mom like people are helping and we got $100 and I was so thankful that people were donating to my family but even though I knew it wasn't enough to cover for the lawyer fee I just figured this is seriously so sweet that people are giving something so I go to the lawyer I tell the lawyer everything that's going on you know I'm 21 years old talking to her as if I know what the heck is going on and she was very touched by our story and so she told me I will do everything including like the trips just to go out to go see my dad and like the paper flow and all of that she would do it for $4,000 and I thought great I have $2,000 what do we do and I look at my mom and I was like can we borrow from someone what do we do so at the lawyer is saying you know I need the payment today in order to start and I'm I decided okay well I'm just gonna look at the GoFundMe and right at that moment I said look at the GoFundMe fundraiser that I set up for my dad I had one thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars and 98 cents so it's two cents short of two thousand it was fine I had that so I am deed out my entire savings was able to use the GoFundMe to pay for the lawyer and then we got my dad out in a month but I think the hardest thing for me was to go visit my dad and to make sure he was doing okay um and to you know see him and like you know to see him and like an orange jumpsuit and with all these people who are scared of getting deported my dad didn't even really do anything wrong it was just a mistake I just felt like this is really hard it was one of the hardest things I ever had to see but I know that there's people who've been through so much worse but during that time I realized how perfect God is my church really helped my family my friends really helped me and even strangers that even really no help my family get through that time so that was and I realized how real God was to me and it was it was only when they literally had nothing to lean on that I realized that God had always been there and that life is so much more than the problems that I feel like are centered around myself because my family is a really big deal thank God has blessed me with a family that cares not only my nuclear family but my church family so that was when I really realized that life is more than just about us so after that my dad got out in a month and that really changed the trajectory of my life and two months later we got evicted again and that was what I thought wow you think those kinds of things only happen once in your life in here it is happening twice in my life which I have a video on that I still question you know God why are you doing this to me but I kind of grew to a point of whatever comes comes all this to say that I went into teaching knowing that I wouldn't be making a lot but that I would trust God with everything that I have and if he's called me to do this then I don't need to worry about anything and truly truly truly I found that in this life we go through hard times because the greatest gift we could have is to be closer to Jesus and to know who God is and through the hard times in my life I've truly realized who God is and how great he is and I think that's something we always need to remember if that that is the greatest goal and that is the greatest gift just to get closer to God whatever it takes and so I hope that we will kind of take our eyes off of ourselves and to fix our eyes on the one above because that's really what's going to sustain us during you know really hard times in life as well that's my story and then here I am a teacher a youtuber and just really trying to make an impact on the world knowing that they are saved by grace and by grace alone and that Jesus is truly enough and he does care and he does love you he does see you so we can rejoice in our sufferings knowing that we are becoming more like Jesus if there's a relationship that you got out of and you just feel empty and you feel like you don't have anything to live for that's the perfect time where you should be single because no relationship should make you feel like you've just kind of stripped your life away then that you don't have your own life and so I told myself I'm gonna stay single for a year or two and I just didn't want to talk to any boys I wanted to just kind of focus on myself and I did and I finally found myself again and realized Who I am as an independent strong woman who you know isn't dependent on anyone but Jesus and then that was when I met my current boyfriend we were just friends for a good two years before always really dating and we have kept our relationship very Christ centered you know focus on who God has called you to be and keep running that race and your significant other will come along while you're running on that path towards chasing after Jesus who is already waiting for you if you like what you see please like and subscribe I'll see you later bye
