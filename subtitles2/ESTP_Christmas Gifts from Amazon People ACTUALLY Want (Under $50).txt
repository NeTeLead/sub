 hi guys welcome back to my channel welcome to a special holiday edition of my videos where we're actually gonna look at Christmas stuff to get people that they actually will want we all have enough lotion you know we have enough socks socks actually would be kind of nice so these are gonna be cool gifts that most people will like all of these gifts are in Amazon because getting to be crunch time and we all know Amazon has really fast shipping so if you're anything like me you haven't even started Christmas shopping I know it's like December 23rd and you're watching this aren't you yeah it's okay that is probably why I am is almost made right yeah no it actually was made to sell books but here we are it's taking over our entire like world so it's fine now we're gonna go from 10 to 110 being the least cool and number one being the best so staple the end number 10 is a blow-dryer brush I know you're like what okay I have a blow-dryer these things are actually amazing you blow-dry your hair with it and brush it at the same time basically your hair dries like you went to the dry bar number nine for those of you that live somewhere that's really cool during the winter I used to live in Seattle and these are awesome it is a heated blanket they also make heated clothing now like you could buy a heated jacket or something like that but I'm telling you a heated blanket is like amazing in the winter when it's just so cold everywhere in your house the actually I'm cool looking ones too like you can get a cheetah printed heated blanket blankets are kind of one of those like lotion water bottle like people don't know it's again so they get you a blanket but a heated blanket now that is actually cool number eight is copper Moscow Mule mugs probably wouldn't get this unless you're over 21 I mean you could I guess these just are so like trendy and cool-looking and I love a good Moscow Mule it's actually a really delicious drink so if you're over 21 this is a good gift because these copper monks they're like kind of a so but this is a set of them for like 30 something dollars number seven is for your want to be influenced or friend I mean it's 2018 most of us have a one or two of those like pretty much everyone wants to be Instagram famous these days right so this one is actually really cool I have one of these and that's awesome it's an iPhone a camera remote and tripod so it's a little Bluetooth remote so you can be standing like 20 feet away from your camera and just like hit the shutter a bunch of times and take a photo way easier than the self timer like the self timer is kind of annoying I see people use these all the time now actually so if you have a friend who's like trying to be Instagram famous or a blogger get them this they'll like it number six is a sunrise alarm clock so we all have a friend who just cannot get up in the morning they're not a morning person this is an alarm clock that will imitate the sunrise and it'll start to make the room bright so they like gently wake up with the sunrise it also just seems kind of cool they have a bunch of different ones on Amazon but the cheaper ones are like under fifty dollars number five is for the opposite this is for your high-maintenance friend that just cannot sleep this is me actually I'm that friend it is a sleep mask but not just any sleep mask this sleep mask like contours around your eye so no light will get in like I'm telling you nothing I wear this thing every night like changed my life this is what it looks like you look like a bug if you wear it actually but it works so number four is a smart notebook so this is a notebook that you could write in and then you sort of scan the pages with your phones so then you have it all on your computer or tablet or whatever this is good for students because a lot of people like to take actual notes and write it out but having a bunch of pieces of paper like it's just so unorganized so this is really cool actually I totally would want one of these if I was still in school next is a tile so this is a Bluetooth tracker that will make a little sound and you can track them on your phone when it's connected to bluetooth this is great for that person in your life that just like cannot keep track of their king their wallet or whatever I know a few and let me tell you something they're not gonna change this is the gift that just keeps giving because when they lose their stuff and then find it again it's like you bought them their keys and their wallet again they'll think of you when they find that stuff and it'll be great I actually have a few of these I put one on my cat so when he goes outside I can find him yeah I'm crazy no I'm actually not yeah that lasted first day and then he hated it but yeah these are actually so awesome if you do lose something highly recommend the last two are smart home items so they're like specifically if you have like an Amazon Alexa a lot of people do so I thought I would throw these and number two is a color changing light so these are just cool you know you can change the vibe of your room they're just fun to have um this one you can get a set for under $50 which is good I promise you like if you have a friend that has an Amazon Alexa or something like they will have fun with this thing and number two is a smart home outlet truly the gift of laziness but like we all love that I mean wouldn't you love to just be like Alexa turn off my lights like I would I need to get some of these for myself actually with these you can be like Alexa good morning Alexa good night and like all your lights will turn off make sure it's a friend that has an Amazon Alexa or a sibling or whatever if they don't have these smart home outlets yet like they will definitely like them like it just makes life easier so that is all the gifts under $50 if you guys have any other ideas comment down below and let me know or let me know what your favorite one was I mean obviously mine you already know it's like the smart home outlets like that's what I want I'll link all of this stuff down below so that you guys can check it out if you're actually interested in getting it yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I will see you in my next video bye.
