 okay this is actually my third time recording this video because I just feel so awkward it's been so long since I've made a video the act of sitting alone in a room and just talking to an inanimate object and hearing yourself talk is very weird it's very unnatural to all the other youtubers out there I really admire you you're taking good job oh my gosh I haven't like self-praise there but no really like some people can talk to a camera so naturally and I feel like maybe I'm not one of those people until I really really warm up so maybe the last two videos are just me warming up anyway welcome back to my channel I'm really glad you guys are sticking with me oh my gosh and to all those people who commented on my previous video I'm so thankful I read all the comments and even some of the people's comments that were a little bit harsh I still like to thank you because well II took time out of your day you watched my video you heard my side of the story and you took time out of your day to comment so I'm really grateful for that and all the other comments oh my gosh you guys have such great things to say some people offered perspectives that I have never really thought about people are relating and I guess I just feel like I'm not alone it sounds kind of silly but I felt kind of unique in this experience I was honestly thinking like okay even if people get divorced there's a divorce proceeding you can't just well I guess some people disappear but generally you have to state your reasons for wanting to get the word like if you've been married for a decade or whatever so I was feeling kind of alone but I guess that was obviously naive of me people have gone through similar experiences and more difficult experiences so for everyone who shared your experience a big thank you to back because ya just made me feel like not alone oh that's so odd because usually I feel like I don't really mind feeling alone I usually want to feel like I'm alone I'm unique and no one understands my pain like I don't know if other infps relate to this but it's kind of maybe enough I think maybe in India ground for thing anyway the comments helped me a lot now let's go to the name change you have good suggestions but then I just decided to name it how I wanted to name my channel okay so the main suggestions or something to do with the theme of coffee so Insp coffee and BTI coffee Insp cafe and VTI cafe they were all really good someone mention Apokolips a-- like the apocalypse but with my name ha ha very funny yeah there were really good name suggestions but in the end i decided to go with casual cognition I just really like that name and I'll explain why I think it fits later but you know the thing about coffee naming it that would be smart to keep like the continuity of previous channel name into current channel name but I just have a different set of associations so that now so like quick lesson I guess on how si works I'm sure it's something previously I had all these positive associations with coffee like self-care time intellectual conversation casual hang out with friends time even like the sod of an acquaintanceship becoming a friendship so I had all these like introverted sensing associations to coffee but then like when I quit coffee because of the negative effects that it had on my body you know that's not to say that caffeine has the same effect on everyone but like I'm their nose to me I was having all these negative effects caused by coffee that I didn't know about until I quit so after I could I have all these negative associations like stress and anxiety and to be honest I have the association to my old channel I guess the channel that I used to run with Alex and I guess I just want to get as far away from that as I can mentally emotionally speaking content speaking it's gonna be like similar it's gonna be like on part but yeah just like mentally I want to detach myself from all of that and I thought that casual cognition was a great name because obviously this channel has always been a little bit casual and I think that's what people liked about it it's it was never two presenters who are experts being like let me tell you everything about kind of functions it was always like oh we're just having a conversation and we might discover some things together and you can tell me your feedback and you know over time I've become more formal but I think my motto has always been Big Ideas small words and that I want to convey the most complex of things in a way that's understandable to everyone I want to use examples that are relatable and understandable to Emily want to do explain like I'm five if you follow that subreddit I just don't see any point in being pretentious or using all these like complex or too complex metaphors when the simple ones will do just fine like I want to make this relatable to everyone so that hopefully more people in the world will catch on that hate kind of fictions I kind of types they're important and they're helpful to my life and I'm gonna apply them and type my friends and everything and besides that I still want to do those more casual videos that are just for fun I'll look for an example my video like 10 sample I enough piece so I'm still gonna do that but I also wanted to do things like to sample fictional iana piece yeah like I wanted to talk about the kind of types of fictional characters obviously that's not a very serious endeavor because it's not really provable well not that the kind of types of real people are currently provable either but it's like I'm on a more happy-go-lucky fun kind of thing and I might do some more skits if I enjoy doing those like even though it's very stereotypical you guys seem to enjoy it too so yeah I might do all sorts of like fun little things to keep myself happy keep myself entertained because if I just present everyday I don't think I'll keep up with this channel I think I'll just burn out yeah and I also like to do life streaming yeah I want to do so many different things so I think by keeping casual on the name I can do all those things and I can explain everything in a casual but effective and relatable manner hopefully and the part about cognition obviously that comes from the kind of functions but cognition is also a universal mental process and I really wanted to put that in the name because I wanted to expand a little bit someone has recommended or requested that I do a topic video on codependency and narcissism that's a very important psychological topic that I like to cover but I feel like if it's just Insp coffee there's not really and in for me to do that but if it's casual cognition I feel like it's the full realm of psychology and here to talk about whatever I want I can talk about like self esteem self development psychological disorders like narcissism and codependency attachment styles love languages like I can talk about all of these things that I'm very passionate about and I think are very helpful to people by the way a lot of people who after I typed them they're like okay so now that I know I'm an INTP or whatever how can I improve my life or how can I use that knowledge to fix my loss low confidence fix my procrastination I'm just like you can't have like you can't fix all of these universal problems by knowing your kind of type like you can help yourself so much by knowing your kind of type of you can't make the universal issues like procrastination or a low self-esteem it's a universal issue not because everyone has low self-esteem but because any type can develop low self-esteem and has nothing to do with type so I'd like to occasionally get into these topics but it's still gonna be mostly young in functions and personality type theory but occasionally I want to go into like more broader psychological topics because I think it's really really really important that you guys know more over cognition is kind of a more formal word so I like the contrast between a casual which is a more informal word and cognition which is more formal or I think it really reflects what I'm trying to do which is discuss something that's extremely useful and has great practical applications and it's quite complex when you look at it deep down and I want to explain it and I you know fun quirky individualistic manner so I hope you guys stick around for that and thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you soon bye.
